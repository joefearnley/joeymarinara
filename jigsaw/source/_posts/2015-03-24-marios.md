Continuing my search for good local pizza in Grand Haven, I set out on my lunch break the other day to find more. There are only a few places around town that serve slices at lunch so my options are limited. One is a local chain named [Palermo’s which I have tried before](#%E2%80%9Dhttp://joeymarinara.com/post/17013724075/palermo-pizza%E2%80%9D) and another is [Mario’s](http://www.ghmarios.com/).

[Mario’s](http://www.ghmarios.com/) is located off US 31 tucked away in a multi-unit location right behind Burger King. They offer pizza, a variety of sub sandwiches, and a handful of Italian dinner dishes. Of course, they also offer slices of pizza at lunch. Inside, the place is really basic, with a window for ordering and pick up, and only a couple of table and chair combinations to sit down and eat at.

On this particular day they had a pepperoni and a deluxe pie sitting in the warmer. They had a deal going where it was 2 slices of pizza and a soda for somewhere under $5. I ordered a couple slices of the pepperoni, filled up my cup with some Diet Coke, and headed out to my car to eat them.

The pizza was cut into large, New York, style slices. If I had to guess, I would say the original pizza was 16 inches. The crust was thin and crispy. The cheese was melted about as well as one could. Unfortunately one of the slices only had one slice of pepperoni on it but the other made up for it. All in all, they were great slices of pizza.

Like I mentioned earlier, the options for pizza by the slice are slim in Grand Haven and so are local pizza places that mainly only do the delivery and takeout thing. With [Mario’s](http://www.ghmarios.com/) being located basically in the middle of town it is always an option for locals. For under $5, I’d definitely give them another go during lunch. They have been around for 30 years so they are certainly doing something right. Don’t sleep on it. Hit up Mario’s when you get the chance.

Final Rating: 3 slices
