You only turn 28 once and my parents wanted to take me out to eat for my birthday. It was my choice and I am on this pizza kick so I opted for [Pietro’s](http://www.rcfc.com/backdoorpizzeria/ "http://www.rcfc.com/backdoorpizzeria/") in Grand Rapids. I haven’t been to this place since travel hockey in the mid 90’s and not a whole lot has changed. The [front portion](http://www.rcfc.com/Pietros/ "http://www.rcfc.com/Pietros/") of the restaurant is what seems to be a somewhat fancy Italian joint. The back portion is a pizza joint with a sports bar vibe. I remember this place being really good back in the day so I figured I’d give it a shot.

We opted for the deep dish. In my head I was planning on chicago style for some reason so I was thrown for a loop when it finally came out. There was an actual chicago style on the menu (which some how I missed) and an award-winning stuffed pie that looked really good. Next time I will have to give one of those a go.

The deep dish was of course excellent. My only complaint being the crust as it was a little overwhelming at times. It was thick though, so much I could only take down two slices. It was warm and the sauce was great (a bit on the sweet side). Again I would really like to try some of the other options Pietro’s has to offer.

Final Rating: 4 slices
