Last weekend I was invited to go snowboarding up north with some friends. I didn’t exactly think this one through as I haven’t been snowboarding in about 20 years. I thought, hey, it should be like riding a bike. I vaguely remember being completely sore afterward when I was high school. I am in my thirties now. Needless to say it made for a long Saturday that was filled with bumps and bruises along with a lot of pizza and beer.

We headed up north first thing in the morning and after stopping at camp Cox for a few minutes, we made our way to [Crystal Mountain](http://www.crystalmountain.com/). As soon as we got all of our gear on and started walking toward the mount I immediately felt the regret set in. I powered through, got my ticket, and hit the mountain. Inevitably, by the time I got down the hill the second time, one of the bindings broke on my board. I could still use the board, though, so I continued.

About an hour later, my friends had long ditched my slow ass and I was getting hungry and decided to pop into [the lodge](http://www.crystalmountain.com/about/dining#Quick-N-Simple) for something to eat. There are a couple of places to eat in the main lodge and I chose the cafeteria around. They had a lot of options to choose from. It was super busy at the time so I decided to quick grab a slice of pepperoni pizza, a beer, paid the cashier, and headed to the outdoor tent to eat.

Looking at the slice of pizza initially didn’t give me hope of anything but decent. It was on the thick side of your typical pie. The cheese was cooked perfect and the sauce gave it gave it a bit of sweetness. I was completely surprised at how delicious this pizza was. I was so hungry that after one slice and a tall Two Hearted, I was ready to hit the slopes again.

When I got done and walked out of the tent I saw my friends on the deck outside drinking beers and decided to join them. Next to them on the deck were about 12 college-aged kids that were completely hammered. It made for some interesting people watching. I now know what white people with money do in the winter time around here. Regardless, try the pizza at the Clipper Café if you haven’t, you will not be disappointed.

Final Rating: 3 slices
