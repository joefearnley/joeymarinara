This fall we took another trip to Colorado. This was going to be a short one, just a few days long. I was hoping to squeeze in a pizza joint at some point. Last time I managed to find [one place that I really liked](http://joeymarinara.com/post/26940371242/dostal-alley-brewpub-casino).We had a list of things to do while we were there that included a couple of brewery tours, Red Rocks, the zoo and of course the beer festival.

That’s right, we managed to score some tickets to the Great American Beer Festival which is basically why we went this time of year. We had a lot planned in the few days we were. The day of the festival we were able to get in on the distillery tour offered by Stranahan’s. They offer free tours of their operation which was only a couple of minutes from where we were staying. After learning how whiskey is made (and drank) we headed to [Fat Sully’s](http://www.fatsullys.com/) for lunch.

From what I understand there are a few of these places around town. We went to the one on Colfax that is actually inside a brewpub called [Atomic Cowboy](http://www.atomiccowboy.net/). There is also a place inside there Denver Biscuit Co. (which we didn’t check out). We got seated, ordered some drinks and checked out the menu.

There were basically three different options for pies - 12", 20" and 26". They also offered pizza by the slice. No slices were available at the moment, so we narrowed it down to a full pizza. After going back and forth on the size, we saw a waitress carrying out a 26" pie and were immediately sold. We ordered one with pepperoni and green pepper. The waitress said it was take a little longer than normal because of the size and were fine with that.

About 25 minutes later the pie came out. I’m not sure if these photos really do it justice but the slices were huge. The only place I’ve had that was comparable was [Georgios](http://) or [Bonanno’s](http://). This was definitely going to be a two-hand job. I was in for a treat.

I took my first bite and let the flavors set in. I managed to get some green pepper in there right out of the gate so it threw things off a bit. I’m not a fan of green pepper on my pie but there were four of us splitting this one and I had to compromise. One thing I noticed about the peppers were that they were were slices and in clumps as opposed to diced like I normally see. It didn’t seem to have any affect on the flavor though.

The cheese and sauce were the perfect mixed. The crust was thin and not too crispy. The slices so big in the end I could take down one and a half of another. After that I was filled to the brim. It was a good preparation for the beer festival. And of course there were left overs that would be devoured later that night.

It turns out this place was [featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives](http://www.fatsullys.com/wp-content/themes/fat-sullys/ddd-overlay.html) which I am sure got it a lot of attention as it should. The place also offers board games to play while to hang out there. I would definitely go back to Atomic Cowboy. After was that video the gourmet biscuits like awesome. While there, you can always grab a slice.
