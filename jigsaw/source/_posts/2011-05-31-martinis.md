Summer is coming and it feels good. My friend Kurt made his semi-annual visit from California to Kalamazoo and I know if there is one stop he makes during his week here it’s [Martini’s](http://martinispizza.net/). He asked if I was up for some dinner there with a few others and I willingly said yes.

Martini’s is an interesting place. When I lived in the vine neighborhood it was a carryout-only joint. They had pizza by the slice and whatever else was on the menu up for take out. A couple of years ago they transformed the place into a full-blown restaurant with two floors and outdoor seating. The owner/operator has a reputation for running a tight ship and apparently this includes the customers (although I’ve never experienced this). Pizza nazi or not the guy knows what he is doing and it’s written in the pie.

Rachel and I ordered a 14-inch pepperoni and cheese. We figured that with a couple of cold beers 7-inches, we’d be more than full. The pizza was great. The sauce has that sweet, tanginess that most places only wish they incorperated into thier pie. With the mealted cheese and hearty pepperoni Martini’s hits it out of the park.

I’m not sure what it is but I have a thing for pizzas that are cut in squares. It makes me wonder if there is a name for this oppposed to slices cut as triangles. I have a lot to learn when it comes to pizza. Maybe if they would have cut it into squares I would have given it five slices. It’s a lesson I’m constantly trying to learn: don’t judge a pizza by its maker.
