The time has come. After many conversations, quite a bit of planning, and a lot of decision making my family finally made our first trip to Disney World. It has been about a year and a half in the making and after a 3 hour plane ride and an hour long bus ride we finally arrive at our hotel in somewhere outside of Orlando, Fl near the land of white hands and big ears.

The resort we stayed at was named [Port Orleans - French Qurter](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/resorts/port-orleans-resort-french-quarter/) which had a theme of, as you probably guessed, New Orleans. With streets named things like “Jazz Alley" and being presented with purple, gold, and green beaded necklaces upon arrival it seemed this place was about as Disney as you could get to New Orleans. Aside from the foot court there was a lounge, large pool, arcade, and gift shop. It was also located right on the river where a boat ride can take you to downtown Disney which was our plan for the day.

Before we caught the boat we decided to grab some lunch at the this place named [Sassagoula Floatworks and Food Factory](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/dining/port-orleans-resort-french-quarter/sassagoula-floatworks-and-food-factory/) which is a super fancy named for the food court located at our resort. We got one of the dining packages where you pay up front for meals and can eat in most places associated with Disney. The place offered just about everything you can think of as far as American fare was concerned but also had Big Easy inspired dishes like Po Boys, Muffuletta, and Jambalaya, although not always available. For my first feast I was more concerned about getting the kids situated so I ended up grabbing a slice of pepperoni pizza.

The slices they offered were pretty large. I only needed one as my stomach wasbeyon empty and filled up fast. The crust was thick and fluffy with not much sauce to speak of. There was a hint of some sort of seasoning on the edges that was a nice surprise. After traveling most of the day and a large slice like that I was kind of ready for a nap but we had plans.

I’ve only been to New Orleans once and that was like 20 years ago. It was a day stop on a cruise and it rained the whole time and I wasn’t 21. Needless to say I didn’t really get the experience most do. Yet as far as Disney is concerned, this seems to be as close as they could get. We ate at [Sassagoula Floatworks and Food Factory](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/dining/port-orleans-resort-french-quarter/sassagoula-floatworks-and-food-factory/) at least once a day, mainly for breakfast but it was also convenient for quick snack. I wouldn’t go out of your way to check this place out but if you stayed at Port Orleans you will definitely be hitting it up a few times.

Final Rating: 3 slices
