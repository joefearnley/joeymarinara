After a [more pizza](http://joeymarinara.com/post/171200632824/saddle-up-frozen-pie) and a few more beers, some of the gang wanted to head back to do some snowboarding. The passes we bought were for all night and they wanted to get their money’s worth. I had my fill for the day so decided to just hang out the lounge and listed to the cover band. After a hour or two of that we headed back to Camp Cox and eventually made our way to [Grille 44](https://grille-44.com/) for a late dinner.

[Grille 44](https://grille-44.com/) is one of the only restaurants and/or bars left in Bear Lake. When we started going up to Camp Cox, like 10 years ago, it was just an ice cream stand. Over the years they slowly started adding things and building up to a full on bar and grill. They pretty much offer anything you could want at a place like this. Burgers, tacos, pizza, steak…the list goes on. I was milling over a few things and decided to go for the trifecta and order another pizza.

I ended up going with a medium pepperoni pie. No one in the group had had it before so I was not really sure what I was getting myself into. I mean, pizza is usually a safe bet but you never know. Regardless, after getting talked into a beer tower our food came out.

The pizza was thin and was served on one of those pizza stand things. The crust had a nice little crunch on the bottom and was nice and soft on the inside. The cheese was probably the best part of the pizza and was piled high. It had great flavor and cause the pizza to be extra greasy. There wasn’t much to the sauce but that didn’t really matter because the cheese was just that good.

I don’t remember the last time I ate pizza from three different places in one day. It couldn’t have happened on a better one though. I had a great time last weekend bro’ing it up. The food was great as was the weather. Unfortunately I think I going to be sore for the rest of the week. Oh, and when you hit up [Saddle Up](http://joeymarinara.com/post/171200632824/saddle-up-frozen-pie) on your next trip up north, save your appetite or thurst for a stop at [Grille 44](https://grille-44.com/). You will not be disappointed.
