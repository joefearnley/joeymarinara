For those of you that are not aware, I play in a band. After a couple of years together we are finally getting around to recording a full-length record this fall. Like most recording sessions, we started with drums. I decided to drop by the studio to slam some beers, take some photos and provide moral support (i.e. crack wise at the expense of Jason). You know, a typical Sunday. Come to find out though, all this stuff builds up quite an appetite so we decided to step out for some pizza. Being that the studio is located in East Town, and Rick’s girlfriend (Jessica) suggested to me how good it was, we decided to head over to [Brick Road Pizza](http://www.brickroadpizza.com/) We jumped in the car and headed a few blocks over.

The place had an eclectic vibe to it and seemed more like a place a bunch of hippies would hang out at drinking tea as opposed to middle-aged Italian men (which I immediately envision when thinking about a pizza joint). The menu offers all kinds of dishes from sandwiches to pasta to pizza to desserts. Apparently they also offered a wide variety of vegan and vegetarian options on the menu which seems to be a common thing around this part of town (and was probably the only reason Marbro agreed on the place).

Once we sat down we ordered a pitcher of beer. Oberon I think it was. We quickly scanned the menu but really didn’t need to. I knew I wanted pizza and didn’t really care about the other options. Once the waiter came back we had our order ready with Rick and Marbro a calzone and Jason and I a medium pepperoni pizza.

We didn’t have to wait long until the food arrived. Our pizza was served on a little pedestal. I t was hot and fresh out of the oven. The cheese nice and melted. The sauce had a little sweetness to it that I loved. The crust was a bit on the softer side but it made for a great combination. In the end, Jason and I ended up polishing of the entire thing. I left the place more than satisfied.

I would definitely try Brick Road again, specifically going back for their Chicago style. For some reason I missed this when looking over the menu. That or I was too occupied with my social environment to pay attention to it. If you are ever in the East Town area of Grand Rapids, there are plenty of places to eat but I would consider Brick Road as they have a little something for everyone.
