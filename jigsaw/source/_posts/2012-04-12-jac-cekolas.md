I attended my first [hackathon](http://www.codeandkegs.com/) a couple of weeks ago and had a hell of time. Maybe too good of a time. Saturday was a little blurring and needless to say by the time I woke up on Sunday I was ready to eat something strong. Pizza was on the mind and I just heard about this place out in Portage that had just opened up. I somehow talked Rachel into and off we went.

I choose a place called [Jac’s Cekola’s](http://www.jacscekolaspizza.com/). Apparently this place has some history. I won’t go into details (you can read all about it on their [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/JACs-Cekolas-Pizza/338935399471427?sk=info)) but some version of it has been around Kalamazoo for a few decades. The latest incarnation occupies what was once Cruiser’s Pub. This time though there is no main wall dividing the main bar and dance floor. Now the setup is basically a bar on one side and dining on the other.

Rachel wasn’t really feeling pizza so I ordered one up for myself. I got a fourteen incher with pepperoni and black olives on it along with a cold PBR draft. The pizza came out hot an ready to eat. The cheese was covering the curst all the way to the edges. the medium-depth crust fit with the toppings. I was really hungry and maybe it was timing but I ended up driving in about half of it. It wasn’t the best in the world but at the time tasted great.

Although I would love to try it again Jac’s its on the other side of town from where I live so I won’t be going there any time soon. If you are in the area I would suggest checking it out. If you’re not really in the mood for pizza they have a bunch of other options. I wouldn’t call the service the best I had but the place is new and it was slow. That’s never a good combination but I’m sure it will get better with time. They did have ledge above the urinals in the men’s bathroom that I’m sure I have seen in other places before but don’t remember and at the time it was complete genius.

Final Rating: 3 slices
