Ray and I have been talking about taking a trip to Chicago since the summer to bring the kids to the aquarium. Some days off came up around the holidays so we decided to take a trip down for a couple of days. We planned to hit [Shedd Aquarium](https://www.sheddaquarium.org/) for sure, stay the night, and hit either [The Field Museum](http://%E2%80%9D) or [the Museum of Science and Industry](http://%E2%80%9D) the next day.

We rolled into town right about lunch time. By the time we parked and made it into the museum we were all pretty hungry. We made our way through most the main floor and on to [The Bubble Net](http://%E2%80%9D). It’s the main café in the aquarium that has just about every food you can think of. It is set up like a cafeteria where you grab a tray, pick what you want, and pay the cashier. With two little ones, I didn’t have much time to mull over the options so I grabbed a piece of pepperoni pizza and moved on.

The place was busy as hell but we managed to find a spot to sit down. The pizza slices are pretty large so I only got one. The crust was thick and for the most part, soft. It seemed to have a cheese mixture of some sort that, event after sitting under a heat lamp for a while I’m sure, tasted pretty good. A couple of the pepperonis were a little burnt but that sometimes adds to things. In this case I can say that it did not. After one large slice, I was good to go until dinner time.

[Shedd Aquarium](http://%E2%80%9D) is always a good time. I always feel like I get a bigger kick out of it than the kids but I guess that is normal. If I had to make a suggestion, I would plan ahead and either grab a bite before you get there or bring something to eat with you. I don’t remember what the final price was for the meal and that is probably for a reason. Once you’re inside they kind of got you.

Final Rating: 2 slices
