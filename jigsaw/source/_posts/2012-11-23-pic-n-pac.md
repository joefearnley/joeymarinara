I was back near the lakeshore over the weekend to show the little one off a little and eat some thanksgiving dinner. It’s always a nice little four-day weekend which is almost always spent entirely in Muskegon. Thought last year Rachel and I did our own thing by heading out to Pittsburgh for a long weekend to see some sites and watch hockey. Thinking back, I don’t think we ate at any pizza while out there which is kind of a bummer. I remember researching a couple but one was in kind of a dicey part of town so we never went. Regardless this year it was back to the same ol’.

My in-laws live near a place called [Pic ‘n Pac](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Pic-N-Pac/146665398690800) in Norton Shores, MI. For those of you that are unaware, it’s a gas start/mini convenience store located in the heart of city. Actually there isn’t really a place like it for a mile or two so it works out well for those in the area. I usually stop there to buy some beer. One particular evening over the course of my stay I stopped in and also picked up a slice of some pizza that looks like it had been sitting out for a day or two.

The place offers all kinds of different ready-to-eat food including sandwiches, rolls and of course, pizza. When I was in highschool my buddy Dave and I would roll up to place on our lunch break, order some chicken fries and a slice of pizza and eat it while listening to Steve Howe’s solo album in Dave’s car. I wonder if they still make those chicken fries. Anyway, I grabbed my beer and pizza and headed out the door.

I actually ended eating the slice in the car on the way to the in-laws. It was the typical type of pizza you’d find at any of the school cafeterias in the area. Burnt, hardened cheese, pepperoni chunks and a crust that was along the lines of cardboard. I did finish it though. The taste though took me back to my younger days when the menu didn’t have choices. It memorable and satisfying at the same time.

Pic 'n Pac is a great convenience store. The staff will always give you a hello when you enter and are willing to help you find anything. I’d stick with the sandwiches though. The pizza certainly won’t keep you coming back.

Final Rating: 2 slices
