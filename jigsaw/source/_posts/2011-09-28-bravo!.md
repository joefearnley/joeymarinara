A lot can happen in fours and well, little can also happen in four years. That’s not to say I live a boring life or anything, it’s just that life goes fast and before you know it you look back and realize how little you’ve accomplished. That’s life though, right? Another thing to note is that I have officially been married for four years. So Ray and I decided to hit up a “higher-end” joint to celebrate the occasion.

We decided on [Bravo!](http://www.bravokalamazoo.com/). I’ve never been to this place before, only have heard that they have a bomb ass brunch on Sundays. They also have a wood-burning pizza oven that cooks “Tuscan-style” individual pies that come in all kids of combinations. The sweet Italian was very tempting as was the chicken Gorgonzola. But I have to keep it consistent, and real, so I went with a pepperoni and black olive.

The one thing that stuck out to me on this pizza was the crust. It was a good and cooked covered in some sort of olive oil I think? Regardless, it was fantastic. The peperoni and black olive was a great comb to go along with the crust. The sauce was a bit on the sweet side that wasn’t a bad addition at all. I housed in all but two slices. I finished the meal off with a whiskey dessert. On the rocks because I didn’t know what my other option was. I have a lot to learn when it comes to fine dining.

Another surprise for the evening was that they had their own craft beer selection. I tried the Pale Ale and the American I.P.A. and was impressed by both. If you don’t like beer they have a hell of a selection of wine. I also heard a They also offer cooking classes in the back of the restaurant to anyone who wants to sign up. When we got up to leave I heard a commotion in back. Apparently they also hold cooking classes on certain night of the week.

Final Rating: 4 slices
