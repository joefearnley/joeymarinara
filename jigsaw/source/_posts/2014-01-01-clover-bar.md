The holidays are winding down which, to me, is always a little bit of a bummer. Part of me is glad that it’s over but now I am looking at a new year, with shit I want to get done (that I probably never will) and its really cold outside. It’s a little depressing.

I was contacted by some family friends who I grew up with wanting to get together for the holidays. Now that we are older, we try to get together at least once and year and catch up. This usually ends up being around the holidays being that those who are out of town can make it. This year it was decided we go to the [Clover Bar](http://www.cloverbar.com/) in Grand Haven (which I kept getting confused with the Old Clover Bar with is a dive off Getty St).

I’ve never been to this place and really haven’t heard much about it. Which is surprising because I’ve eaten at the Fricano’s down the street a handful of times over the course of my life. The place had a neighborhood bar feel to it. One that included the entire family. There was a bar, a dining, and arcade area. The place was opened in 1963 and, from what I could tell not a whole lot has been changed except for the wood paneling that was painted white (which I would have kept brown, but that’s me). The good news was we had reservations because the place was packed.

The menu contains appetizers, pasta, salad, sandwiches, and pizza. The last is what they are known for so that’s what we ended up getting. We ordered one pie with pepperoni, mushroom, and sausage and one with just pepperoni. The first pie came out one time with the rest of the groups but the pepperoni did not. The waitress apologized and let us know it would be out soon. I was really hungry at the time and didn’t want to wait for the pepperoni so dug in the the first pie.

My first impressions were how much the pizza resembled Glenside Pub. It had the same feel - a ton of cheese, sauce a bit on the sweet side, and massive pepperoni. My only dislike would be I prefer non-canned mushrooms whenever I have the choice. Unfortunately, we didn’t get one.

The small pepperoni eventually came out and was very much along the same lines. Thin crust, big pepperonis, and a little extra parmesan for good luck. I took down about half of the small pizza. Along with an additional slice from the large and a couple of Two Hearted’s I was completely full.

I’m really happy I got to check the [Clover Bar](http://www.cloverbar.com/) out. Currently this place is only 15 minutes from my house which is totally dangerous. The fact that it is located a bit off the beaten path in Grand Haven doesn’t really make it a tourist attraction per se, but if plan on going around dinner time, get a reservation or plan to wait. Either way, I’d check it out.

Final Rating: 4 slices
