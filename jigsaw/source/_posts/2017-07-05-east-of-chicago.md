Last Friday it was dinner as usual. No one wanted to cook and no plans had been made. Someone brought up pizza which is the go to for Fridays. After some discussion around it, I was able to sell everyone on trying something new and my mother-in-law brought up this place call [East of Chicago](http://www.eastofchicago.com/). We had not tried that yet so Ray put in an order and I went to pick it up.

[East of Chicago](http://www.eastofchicago.com/) is actually a chain that has been in the area for several months. I can’t tell you how many locations there are but they seem to be all over the Midwest and parts of the South. They offered a variety of pizza, subs, wings, salads, appetizers, and desserts. This particular location also had a bar so that offered a variety of craft beers including local ones.

They also have a buffet most days of the week which, after seeing pictures of it on Facebook, was one of the reasons I wanted to check the place out. We ordered a large Chicago-style pie with a large salad to share as a side. They have a separate entrance for takeout orders which was convenient. I paid for the food and headed back to eat.

When we got home I grabbed a slice, some salad, and a beer then headed out to the patio. After a couple of bites I felt like the sauce was a little off. It was really thick and chunky. It almost seemed like a combination of marinara and spaghetti sauce with not a whole lot of flavor. Unfortunately compared to most Chicago-style pizzas I’ve had it was lacking in the amount of cheese used as well. After two slices I’d had enough.

Unfortunately few days before I wrote this, the local [East of Chicago](http://www.eastofchicago.com/) announced on their Facebook account that [they are closing their doors](https://www.facebook.com/eastofchicagomuskegon/posts/1705280079778408). Some people blame the location because every previous business that occupied this space does not stay there long (which is weird because it in the middle of one of the busiest areas around). Regardless it sort of bums me out. I’m not exactly in love with their pizza but it is just another business in the area that couldn’t make it. They also seemed like a place that wanted to do right by the community and not just make money. Unfortunately, I will never get to try any of their other pizza or sandwiches. Rest in Peace, East of Chicago, you will be missed.

Final Rating: 2 slices
