After not planning a dinner last Friday (as usual) Ray asked me if I wanted to get pizza. She didn’t care where it was from so I got to choose. There are a handful of places on my list to try out. I wasn’t starving so none of the options really stuck out to me. Eventually I decided on [Zaloma’s](https://www.facebook.com/zalomaspizza/).

[Zaloma’s](https://www.facebook.com/zalomaspizza/) is located in the part of Muskegon named Lakeside. I grew right down the street from the location and back then (in the early 90’s) it was party store. Since then it has been a number of different businesses. After sitting empty for a while [Zaloma’s](https://www.facebook.com/zalomaspizza/) moved in around the middle of 2017. The inside is pretty basic with only a counter to order and pay and a bar that goes around the outside with some stools and a couple of high tables. The menu is pretty basic as well including a handful of signature pies with names like the lil’ clucker, razorback, and the funky veggie that come in only a 12” and 16” size. I ordered a pepperoni and bacon 16” for takeout, picked it up 15 minutes later and headed back home to eat it.

As soon as I got home I grabbed a beer and dug into the pie. The crust was a bit flowery and chewy. Each slice was pretty greasy from the cheese and bacon combination. It certainly had some spiciness to it. Attempting some detective work on it I could not figure out if it was coming from the pepperoni, the sauce, or both. The combination of them though was excellent. The slices were fairly small so I ended up eating about 4 or 5 of them.

[Zaloma’s](https://www.facebook.com/zalomaspizza/) is a great addition to revitalization of the Lakeside neighborhood. I hope they last a long time there. With [Hab’s](http://joeymarinara.com/post/66840298325/habs) recently [closing up shop](http://www.mlive.com/news/muskegon/index.ssf/2018/03/muskegon_favorite_habs_good_ea.html) down the road, the odds of that happening are pretty good. If you are in the Lakeside area make sure you give [Zaloma’s](https://www.facebook.com/zalomaspizza/) a shot. Don’t expect to be grabbing a pie after Marine Tap closes because they close a little early.

Final Rating: 3 slices
