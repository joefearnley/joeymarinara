Monday was a rough one. I played hockey for the first time since March and my body was totally feeling it. I woke up a little late, rushed out of the house, and forgot to grab my lunch. Lunch time came and I needed to decide where to go. I was going to just make a quick stop at Jimmy John’s and call it a day but I wasn’t in any sort of hurry so I looked at my options. In the same parking lot as JJ’s there is a Meijer, a Pizza Ranch, and a Mexican joint. I’ve never tried [Pizza Ranch](https://pizzaranch.com/) before so I thought why not?

[Pizza Ranch](https://pizzaranch.com) is a buffet-style restaurant with a focus on, you guessed it, pizza. It is a chain with around 200 locations across the country. Of course there are plenty locations in Michigan as us Midwesterners love our buffets. It also has a “ranch” theme to it with things like wagons, boots, and barns decorating the inside. The menu mainly consists of pizza and fried chicken, which I thought was an interesting combination. You can order meals for takeout or stay for the buffet. I opted for the later.

After getting greeted at the counter and paying my $10 I grabbed a plate and dug in. Some of the options were mac and cheese, potato wedges, fried chicken, French fries, wings, and about 5 different pizzas of all variety. I started slow with a small salad and moved on to the pizza. I grabbed a slice of meat lover’s, a slice of pizza, and a breadstick.

The pizza was pretty basic. The crust had a little thickness to it, the toppings were cooked pretty well (a little too well for some of the pepperoni), and there was plenty of cheese. The breadsticks were also pretty basic and the marinara was great. In my second round I opted for a slice of the fresh cheese pie that had just come out and a piece of chicken. The cheese was as good as the other pieces I had (basic) and the fried chicken was delicious. Honestly, I don’t remember the last time I have had a piece of fried chicken. It must have been year.

If all-you-can-eat pizza and fried chicken is your thing, [Pizza Ranch](https://pizzaranch.com/) will be your go-to spot. I personally won’t be ordering takeout from here any time soon but it can be saved for a change of pace. I certainly didn’t eat what I think was $10 worth of food which didn’t do it justice for me. But the cool thing is you have a lot of options at a place like this and they have something called [Buffet Your Way](https://pizzaranch.com/menu/buffet) which encourages customers to request which pizza you would like to try next.

Final Rating: 3 slices
