Wow. What a weekend. My friend Justin is getting married in a few weeks and a group of us went to Grand Rapids for a bachelor party on Saturday. The only thing that was set in stone for the day was the comedy show at Dr. Grins later on in the evening. After an exchange of a few text messages, we planned on meeting up at [Grand Rapids Brewery Company](http://www.grbrewingcompany.com/) downtown for lunch and beers. Then play it by ear until the show.

The Grand Rapids Brewery Company originated in the late 1800’s and after prohibition closed up shop. It was born again in the early 1990’s at a location on 28th St. by The Orbit Room. I went to the location a couple of times before some shows but never tried the food. They moved locations to a prime spot downtown location a couple of years ago and I’ve wanted to check it out ever since.

There were about 12 of us and they sat us right in the middle of the place at a long table. After ordering beers and taking down half an IPA, I started checking out the menu. Unlike a lot of breweries in the area, they didn’t offer straight up pizza. The closest thing was this appetizer named That Pizza Thang. Even after the server explained what it was I still wasn’t sure was it was. I didn’t feel like a sandwich and the entrees looked like a bit much, so I decided to go with That Pizza Thang.

When my food arrived it looked pretty good. It was four pieces of toasted bread with pepperoni, marinara, and melted cheese on top. It resembled something between French bread pizza and a bagel bite. I wasted no time and dug in. The pepperoni was a bit thick and a little spicy (not a bad thing). The marinara was a bit bland but the cheeses made up for it. Combine all that with some lightly toasted bread and you are onto something. I ended up eating them all and was completely full afterward.

[Grand Rapids Brewery Company](http://www.grbrewingcompany.com/) is a really cool spot. Seeing what some of the others got for lunch makes me think I will try something different next time. Oh and the beer was good too. It’s not the cheapest place in town but the quality of the beer and food certainly make up for. If you find yourself downtown sometime and the wait for Hop Cat is over an hour, slide on down the GR Brewing Co. I think you will like it.
