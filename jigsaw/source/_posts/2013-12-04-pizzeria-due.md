About a month ago, Ray pitched the idea of going to Chicago for a night or possibly long weekend to do a little shopping and see the band Less Than Jake play. I’m always down for a trip to Chicago. And a punk rock show? Here, twist my arm. Upon planning we realized we could only go one night and we had to get some shopping in. So I booked a room at a hotel downtown where a bunch of my friends who were also staying (and going to the Less than Jake show) and headed out on that Saturday morning.

We made pretty good time on the road. We were staying at The Inn which is right downtown about a block away from Magnificent Mile. After finding some parking nearby we paid the tenant and headed to the hotel. It was approaching noon and Ray and I were both getting pretty hungry. After checking in, I did a quick little search on my phone for pizza places in the vicinity while we got settled in the room. Of course there were plenty of places around but I was kind of stuck on [Uno’s](http://www.unos.com/). The original location was only a few blocks away and I’ve always wanted to check it out. So we made our way down stairs and headed over there to see what it was all about.

For those of you who don’t know, [Uno’s](http://www.unos.com/) is a Chicago Staple that serve’s original deep dish pizza. It’s originally location was opened in the 1940’s and eventually turned into a franchise. It’s appeared on the travel channel a couple of times for both Pizza Paradise and Food Wars (where they competed against [Lou Malnati’s](http://joeymarinara.com/post/61201158534/lou-manaltis)). Needless to say the pretty much invented the Chicago style deep dish and so that automatically makes me a fan.

As we approached the location you could see it was pretty busy. Turns out being on Television makes you kind of a tourist destination. I asked the woman at the door what the wait would be and she mentioned it would be a 50 minute wait and then another 45 - 60 minutes to cook the pizza. I was starving at this point so I made the call to move on. Walking back across the street I noticed a sign that looked exactly like that of Uno’s about a block away. We decided to walk down to see what it was. Apparently, Uno’s opened a second location a shortly after the first, a block away, naming it Pizzeria Due. I had no idea this existed, I obviously didn’t do my research.

We walked in and besides the entire soccer team in the waiting area that moved along fairly quickly, we got seated right away. We ordered some beers and pondered the menu for a while. After a little back and forth we decided to split the Numero Uno, minus peppers. We now had 45 minutes to kill so we ordered a couple more beers.

Eventually the pie came out. It was sizzling hot and smelled amazing. I pulled off a slice and went to town. Mind you, this was some really deep stuff. The cheese completely smothered the slice. Both the pepperoni and sausage had a little kick to them with the sausage being kid of sweet. There wasn’t a ton of topping which left more room for the cheese (which I certainly appreciated).

The crust was cooked to perfection. Not overdone, not too flaky, just enough crunch to compete with the cheese. The sauce was more of a chunky style as opposed the paste. I’m not sure if I could tell the freshness much on this one. In the end, I took down about a slice and a half and celebrated every bite.

I know a lot of people say that this style of pizza is not really pizza. I don’t care, even though I can really only take down about one slice, I love it. It won’t be hard to find an Uno’s around Chicago (maybe even the country) but a trip to one of the downtown locations should be on your bucket list. I don’t get to downtown much when in Chicago and was glad I got to cross this one off my list. I have two more that I would like to eventually hit up - Giordano’s and Geno’s East. One day.

Fortunately, this wasn’t the end of my pizza tasting this weekend in Chicago. I wasn’t planning on it but I had another run in with the pizza best. Stay tuned for round two, it was a pleasant surprise.

Final Rating: 5 slices
