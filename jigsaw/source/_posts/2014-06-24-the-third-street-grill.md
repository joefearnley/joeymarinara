Since starting my new job I’ve been eying a few places to eat. Most days I either bring my own lunch or am in a hurry so I hit up one of the fast food joints in the area. Last week a group of co-workers suggested hitting up the restaurant in the lobby of the Holiday Inn called [Third Street Grille](https://www.facebook.com/ThirdStreetGrille/). They have a lunch buffet during the week and someone got a hold of a coupon online that was buy one, get one free, so we decided to hit it up.

The Third Street Grille is located in the Holiday Inn in downtown Muskegon. I’m not sure how long it has been there, but it’s been several years now. When I was a kid my family would stay at the hotel (it was a Hilton back then) during the Lumbertown festival and I don’t recall a restaurant being there but there was always some sort of bar or lounge.

I didn’t look at the menu, so I am not sure what they offer outside of the buffet, but from what I could tell it they had a little bit of everything. The buffet offered pizza, salad, pasta sandwiches, and a couple of deserts. I opted for a bit of the pizza, a hunk of sandwich, and a little pasta.

The pizza was that of a flatbread style. At the time they only had two options. One was what I would call a Southwest mix. It had tomatoes, bacon, corn, black beans, and some sort of white sauce. You couldn’t really taste the white sauce and the corn and black beans were a little overbearing. I suppose the bacon could have saved it but I think there was one piece on each piece of pizza that I got.

The other option had broccoli, bacon, and, from what I could tell, the same white sauce. Like with the other, I could not white sauce. I am all about broccoli in certain dishes but for me pizza is not one of them. Unfortunately I had the experience with lacking bacon which I think could have also saved this pie.

Buffets are tricky and if not done right can leave a lot to be desired. That is certainly what happened in my case. I would only suggest it if you are not paying, even with a half-off coupon. Being in the location it is, the [Third Street Grille](https://www.facebook.com/ThirdStreetGrille/) has a lot of potential. There are not a ton of places to eat in downtown Muskegon and this place is kind of a pillar. I would definitely give the place another try but I am defnitely going to order something off the menu.

Final Rating: 2 slices
