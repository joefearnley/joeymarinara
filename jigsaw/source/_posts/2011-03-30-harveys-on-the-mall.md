Once again, it’s a Wednesday night, we’re looking to go get something to eat and no one can decide where to go. Whenever this happens everyone pretty much ends up deciding on what’s become known as default: [Harvey’s on the Mall](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Harveys-on-the-Mall/239307885386). Well Harvey’s to most of the world.

For those of you who know me know that if there was one place I would call my watering hole it would be Harvey’s. I’ve had most most of the things on the menu by now including the pizza. The have a fancy oven in the back where they cook pizza, Stromboli and even subs I think. Some times it’s a crap shoot with the pizza because it doesn’t quite cook all the way through every time leaving a little doughiness in the middle. This particular night was different for some reason. First of all the Red Wings were on and this season they started a special where if the Wings are playing your can get a one topping pizza for $3.99. At that price you just can’t afford not to. So I did and I have to say it was probably the best pizza I’ve had at Harvey’s. Have they figure this out? I’m sure I’ll find out soon enough as the NHL playoffs are soon going to be upon us and I’ll probably using it as an excuse to get some of this pie. I wish Rachel could say the same for the chili lately.

As for the taste of the pizza, well, it’s nothing special. But for four bucks and a decent taste it’s getting two slices right out of the gate. Being that it was was and about the same the next morning I’m bumping it up a slice. Maybe we’ll do a round two next time.

Final Rating: 3 slices
