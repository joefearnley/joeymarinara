Spending another weekend out of town, I was scrambling just trying to get to work at the beginning of the week let alone try and pack something to eat for lunch. I figured since the new year had officially begun I was going to start a diet one of these days but being unprepared makes it a lot easier to decide to eat out. And being that my days are numbered I thought I better get some pizza in while I can regardless of [the weekend I had](http://joeymarinara.com/post/40065608146/bernie-os).

After little deliberation I ended up deciding on [Russo’s on 44th St](http://www.russospizza530-3200.com/). According to Google they have a couple of locations in the area. Or maybe not, I really can’t tell. There is the one on 44th St., a restaurant in Cutlerville, and a deli somewhere else in town all with the same name. From the outside it makes a lot of sense but I can’t seem to figure out if there is a correlation between the three. Regardless, I headed over the place on 44th St. to grab a couple of slices.

The place was like most of the small pizza joints around the area. It is located in a strip mall and the inside consists of a couple of table/chair combinations and a counter. When asked what I wanted, I asked what slices were available. The employee proceed to pull out a few people boxes and gave me my options. I don’t remember exactly what they were just that I ended up with two slices of pepperoni and a slice of ham and bacon. I left the place with a total under $5 and headed back to the office.

The weather wasn’t too bad that day so I posted up an an empty parking lot and cracked the box open. I ate one of the pepperoni slices first. It was a little on the non-fresh side. It tasted a little like it had been out awhile even though they did put it in the oven before they sold it to me. Now the ham and bacon tasted fresh out of the oven. The cheese was melted and chewy with just enough sauce to keep the taste alive. The crust was pretty typical of that of one of these carry out joints as well as the meats. I took all of the slices down in a matter of minutes leaving me satisfied.

Russo’s wasn’t too bad. It certainly was cheap and the pizza was pretty good but was pretty ordinary. I wouldn’t be making any special trips to the place but if you are in the the area and are on a budget you can fill up for pretty cheap here. That or you can just hang out for some free smells.

Final Rating: 3 slices
