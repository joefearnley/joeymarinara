I sometimes find myself driving by certain establishments and wondering “What is that place all about?”. The Pizza and Sub shop in Muskegon is one of those. I’ve driven by it a thousand times and have never given it a try. When asking people about it, the response I would get would be they have never tried it, tried it once and never went back, or they love it and go there all the time. The location is an interesting one, stuck on Summit in between Henry St. and Seaway Dr.

I wasn’t sure if they delivered or not and was curious what was on the menu. I assumed pizza and subs and after quick search on the internet, I still wasn’t sure. They have no website or Facebook page. The only thing I could find was [a page on allmenus.com](http://www.allmenus.com/mi/muskegon-heights/47792-pizza--sub-shop/menu/). Who knows if that was up to date. I would have liked to see some options but I pretty much knew what I wanted.

I called the number, ordered a large pepperoni pie, and picked it up about 20 minutes later. The place was your typical pizza joint on the inside. Fairly small, smelling like parmesan, just a counter and a few places to sit. I paid the friendly man behind the counter then headed back home picking some beers up on the way.

I got home and dug right in. The crust was thin and crispy. It appears they did the move where they put the toppings down first then cover it with cheese. The sauce had a good flavor, only a hint of sweetness but a lot of tomato. The cheese was melted nicely with a bit of brown color to it. It kind of chunked up on the top a bit causing it to separate from the crust a little. After several slices, I was satisfied.

The pizza overall was very good. Ray didn’t agree with me, which means we will probably never order it again. I don’t remember exactly what I paid for the pizza, I think it was around $13-$14, so I can’t argue that it was much of a deal. The options for subs there was much more abundant. Maybe next time (if there is one) I’ll probably go that route.

Final Rating: 4 slices
