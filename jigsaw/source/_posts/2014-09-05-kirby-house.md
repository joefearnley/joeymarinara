The summer is winding down and so is my current gig. This the part of the year where you look back and realize you have only been to the beach once (if at all) and you will never get that time back. Winter is rearing its ugly head and as I begin to become a little depressed about that, I also get to look for a new start professionally. You have to take the good with the bad, I suppose.

The other day I was in downtown Grand Haven the other day for a meeting and once it ended I did not have anything to do for the rest of the day. I was hungry and started eying a few places to eat. After a stroll up and down the main drag I noticed [Kirby House](http://www.thegilmorecollection.com/kirby.php) had a sandwich board out offering a lunch buffet, so I crossed the street and decided to check it out.

Sometime in the fall, after tourist season winds down, they offer a lunch buffet and a bargain price to get people in there to eat. The buffet is pretty compact, offering a salad, a pasta option, and a few different pizza options. After being sat I ordered an IPA and went up to check out what was available. On this particular day, it some sort of southwest garden salad, bowtie pasta with red sauce, three different pies, and breadsticks.

I started off with some of the salad and a couple of breadsticks. I also started with a slice of pizza. The pasta didn’t look very appetizing, so I passed on that. After getting off to a good start with the salad I tried the pizza. This one was white sauce, chicken, and onion. It was not a very good combination as far as I am concerned but was not horrible.

After getting off to a rough start I headed back up for more. This time I got a couple of slices of the pepperoni, a slice of ham and cheese, and a couple more breadsticks. The sauce was pretty scarce on the pizza but I got a side of marinara to make up for it. It appeared the pizza had been sitting out for a while, so the cheese had tightened a bit. The toppings were really thick (even the pepperoni) which was a little different but still tasty. I got a couple more slices before calling it a day. I did not want to end of in the hurt box for the rest of the day.

I’ve only been to [Kirby](http://www.thegilmorecollection.com/kirby.php) a few times and have never eaten there. Apparently they have wood-fired pizzas they offered at [K2](http://www.thegilmorecollection.com/k2.php), which is basically the upstairs section of the restaurant. I’d really like to check it out especially in the summer time. From the pictures I have seen, they pizzas look really good. As for the lunch buffet, with a price tag of around $9, I would look elsewhere.

Final Rating: 2 slices
