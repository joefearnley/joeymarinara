I first heard the band [The Falcon](https://www.facebook.com/MoFukkinFalcon/) in 2005 on my XM Sirius radio player I won that came with a free, 6-month subscription. As a fan of The Lawrence Arms, I was instantly a fan of The Falcon and wanted to hear more. Finding music (then purchasing or downloading it) was not as easy in 2005 as it is now, especially a band on a label that only had 3 releases at the time. I soon figured out who The Falcon was and that I could stream one of their on their label’s ([Red Scare](http://www.redscare.net/site/)) website. I was hooked.

Fast forward 10 years and [Red Scare](http://www.redscare.net/site/) is celebrating its 10 year anniversary as a label with a weekend of shows at The Metro in Chicago. My friend Steve and I got tickets for Saturday with a lineup that consisted on a bunch (13?) current and former bands of the label including Direct Hit, The Holy Mess, Teenage Bottlerocket, and of course, The Falcon.

After grabbing some lunch at the infamous [Hopleaf](http://www.hopleafbar.com/) (sandwich pictured below) we headed back to Steve’s for a bit then headed off the show.

It started around 4pm and went until it the last band finished. We saw so many great bands play and it awesome. As the day drug on though, we started to get hungry. The venue allowed you to leave and come in whenever you wanted so we decided to venture out and get something to eat. After I picked up a Direct Hit shirt from their merch booth (which I apparently almost knocked over, but we won’t get into that) we headed out to grab some grub.

The Unfortunate part about this night is we never made it back to the show to see The Falcon but we did hit up a few bars and a pizza joint named [Renaldi’s](http://renaldispizzachicago.com/) to grab some pizza. Steve and Lisa referred to this place as their go to pizza place when they lived in Boystown. We took a seat at the bar and ordered some drinks. They offer options for what they called their pan pizza but we opted for the traditional Renaldi’s, a large pepperoni.

About 10 minutes later the pizza came out and was looking tasty. The large was big enough to have it party cut so I grabbed a couple of squares. It had a thin crust but was not too crispy on the bottom. The cheese was probably the best part. It tasted fresh and there was a lot of it. The sauce has combined with the cheese nicely and the pepperonis were a bit on the crispy side which added a nice little crunch when you bit into them. I don’t know how many slices I ended up eating but I’m sure I could have taken in more.

This trip to Chicago was a memorable one. Congratulations to Red Scare on 10 years as a record label. I hope they have many more and release a whole bunch more records along the way. As for Renaldi’s, I hope to make my way back there again someday. The pizza was great and the atmosphere only added to it. There are plenty of options in the Lakeview neighborhood but don’t be afraid to give [Renaldi’s](http://renaldispizzachicago.com/) a try. It’s been there for over 30 years and there is a reason for that.

Final Rating: 4 slices
