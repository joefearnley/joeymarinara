So I just got back from a summer trip up north. There’s already a [blog post about it](http://blog.joefearnley.com/post/1039790515/sunday-social-48-summer-vacation "http://blog.joefearnley.com/post/1039790515/sunday-social-48-summer-vacation") so I will spare the details. I really planned on hitting up more pizza spots on the adventures but it just didn’t happen. There are two things you need to eat when visiting the upper peninsula of Michigan and pizza is not one of them. Stick with the pasties and the white fish, you’ll be better off for sure. My co-workers were telling me that if there is one thing to do in Munising it is to hit up [Dogpatch](http://www.dogpatchrestaurant.com/ "http://www.dogpatchrestaurant.com/") (and to try the fish, there is usually a buffet). Did I do as they suggested? Sort of. We certainly hit the restaurant up but I was on a mission for pizza. 

Neither Rachel or I are big seafood people so we decided to share a pie. I don’t think there were many options to choose from. All I could picture was a stack of pre-made ones in the back. As far as the taste was concern I don’t know if I’ve ever had worse pizza. The crust tasted like cardboard, the cheese was cooked beyond return and the sauce was so hot it burnt the inside of my mouth. An unpleasant experience to say the least but I knew what I was getting myself into.

It was served on a neat little pedestal though and the restaurant itself was pretty cool. Apparently it’s themed after an old comic strip or some shit so the decor was a little wild at points (and that’s probably the only reason it’s getting a slice). We got to see some local color and take in some real U.P. Next time though I’ll opt for the fish. 

Final Rating: 1 slice
