Like I [mentioned in the previous post](http://joeymarinara.com/post/77329813150/pizzeria-due), my pizza eating for the weekend did not stop at Pizzeria Uno. After a little shopping, plenty of drinking, a limo ride and watching Masked Intruded (only one song), Anti-Flag and Less Than Jake play, I along with about 8 friends found ourselves in Wicker Park outside of the Concord Music Hall. The last thing I had to eat was Uno’s around lunch time so needless to say I was pretty hungry.

We all jumped in a couple of cabs and headed down Milwaukee St. Someone mentioned we were going for burgers. Now why, exactly, we got in a cab rode several blocks, I don’t recall. Things were a little hazy at this point. I’m not sure if someone knew where we were going or what the deal was. In this part of town it seemed like you could walk a block or two and find a place that served burgers because there were bars all over the place. I didn’t matter because I was along for the ride.

Regardless, the cabs stopped several blocks down the road, we got out and went around the corner and started checking out restaurants. We found one that served burgers and tried to get a table. They told us that there would be a wait. At this point, a few people piped up and mentioned there is a pizza joint two doors down that is open and pretty much empty. After little debate, we all pretty much decided that would be a better idea and off we went.

The place was called [Dimo’s](https://www.dimospizza.com/) and was located in the area of Wicker Park known to some as “six corners” (I believe because of the crazy intersection it’s near in which one on the corners stands [the most amazing looking Walgreen’s I’ve ever seen](#%E2%80%9Dhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vAj0ojTeHyI/ULSahkFejNI/AAAAAAAAOZc/EvbxHL-LbU8/s1600/walgreensexterior.jpg%E2%80%9D)). Walking in the place, it immediately reminded me of [Georgio’s in downtown Grand Rapids](#). They serve pizza by the slice, large in size and have a plethora of beverages to choose from. They offered [a ton of different, sometimes unusually, options](https://www.dimospizza.com/menu) which, unfortunately, they don’t always have ready.

I have to be honest, I really don’t remember what my options were at the time but somehow I ended up with a slice with ham, tomato and a few different cheeses on it. Referencing back to the menu, the closest thing I saw to this is called the Tomato Pesto with pieces of ham on. Whatever it was, I ended up drizzling it with Sirarchi sauce and dug in. My other confession here is that I don’t actually remember how it tasted. (yeah, I know). All I can tell you is that it was a decent size and I ate the whole thing. So it must have been pretty good. I do remember, and maybe it was because of photo, that Jason ordered a slice of the Mac ‘n Cheese which apparently that is one of the signature pies there.

All in all, Dimo’s was really a pleasant surprise. The food was good, the atmosphere was great and there was some crazy painting on the wall that looked like some sort of miral of 80’s movie references. The place even had a little stage near the door that I assume holds musicians from time to time. Before I left I said one of the others that if I ever opened a pizza joint I would definitely model after this place. It was that cool.

Ray and I ended up leaving Chicago the next morning. Of course, not without stopping by [Lucky’s](http://www.luckysandwich.com/) on the south side on our way out. Not only did I eat a ton of pizza there but I also had one of my favorite sandwiches before leaving town. Gotta love love that town.

Final Rating: 3 slices
