Last Friday the in-laws were over to our house and when I got home from work we talked about what we were going to do for dinner. Someone brought up [Greek Tony’s](http://greektonys.com/) pizza as an option. I’d had Greek Tony’s only one time before and enjoyed it. I voted yes, as did the other, so I hit the internet to see what exactly was on the menu.

[Greek Tony’s](http://greektonys.com/) is somewhat of a staple in Muskegon. They’ve been around as long as I can remember and have had various locations around town (and are now curious as to how I’ve only had it one other time). Currently there is a location in Muskegon and Ferrysburg with another to open up soon on Sherman Blvd. in Muskegon as well. They offer pizza, subs, salads, and full chicken dinners if that is your thing. They also offer something called the [Colossus Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-DM9dGKks) where if two people can eat a 30” pizza in less than an hour you get the pizza free, some gift cards to come back and use, and your name a wall for bragging rights.

After some debate over the menu and some promises made we decided on a 16” pie with black olives, sausage, mushrooms and bacon. We ordered it up for takeout because I had to make a pit stop for wine a go along for dinner. I was home in about 20 minutes and sat down to eat.

The pizza was a thin style with a little padding on the bottom. The outside crust was cooked enough to give it a little crunch, party cut to perfection. The toppings and cheese tasted very fresh. The sauce added a nice tomato combined with garlic flavor that lit my tast buds up. I was so hungry and this pie was so good, I could have eaten more but had to hold myself back.

I have to say, the first time I tried [Tony’s](http://greektonys.com/) pizza I seemed to enjoy it more. Maybe it was all of the different toppings this time but I’m not sure. I will say this isn’t the last time I’ll be having [Greek Tony’s](http://greektonys.com/). I can always go got a good sandwich so I will have to give their Subs a try some time. If you are in Muskegon or Ferrysburg and are looking for some great pizza, be sure to give [Greek Tony’s](http://greektonys.com/) a shake. I know I will.

Final Rating: 4 slices
