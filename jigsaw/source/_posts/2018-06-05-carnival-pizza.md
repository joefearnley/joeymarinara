Here in Michigan summer is starting to creep its beautiful head out for us to see and long with that comes outdoor activities. Included with that here in the midwest is carnivals and fairs. In the Muskegon area, one of the first of the year is [Fruitport Old Fashion Days](https://visitmuskegon.org/event/fruitport-old-fashioned-days-3/). Like most festivals of the summer it includes a parade, carnival, and at some point near the end, fireworks!

The one thing that always gets me about this place is the parking. Unless you are one of the early or lucky ones, plan on a parking parking spot a good 15 minute walk away once the afternoon comes. It is not so bad as an adult but once the sun is out and two little kids are dragging down your speed, it becomes annoying super fast. Once you get inside and that fresh smell of animal dung and elephant ears hits your nose the walk up is long forgotten.

This year, we grabbed some tickets first then headed to the giant carpet slide thing. The bumper cars were next, then the mini roller coaster, and finally the carousel. These carnival rides were creating an appetite in most of us so we hit the food area to see what the options were. As you can imagine, it is your typical carnival/fair style food. I was in the mood for pizza and after hitting one stand for some french fries I went and grabbed a slice.

I ended up with pepperoni and honestly donâ€™t remember what the other options were if any. The slice was piping hot and had to wait a while for it to cool down. As the cheese on the top started to melt completely off I dug in. The crust was like cardboard with the cheese not wanting to stick to anything. The sauce was pretty flavorless with the pepperonis not adding much. I was hoping for a more greasy flavor but I ended up with bland.

Why it is called Old Fashion Days (and why Ray insists on going each year) is beyond me. I think I read at some point there was an old fashion theme but I am not going to do any further research at this point. Regardless, amongst its funky smells, carnies barking, dangerous rides, and wonderful people watching one this is for sure: it is a sure sign of warm weather for the next few months.

Final Rating: 2 slices
