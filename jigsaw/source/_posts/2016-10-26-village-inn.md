A few days ago some coworkers and I decided to do lunch and were contemplating where to go. I’ve suggested pizza a few times to them and have never gotten a bite. I thought I would go for and suggest pizza again and actually got a couple of them to bite this time. I suggested [Village Inn](http://%E2%80%9D) as on weekdays at lunch they have an all you can eat pizza buffet for $6.99. We all agreed and off we went.

[Village Inn](http://%E2%80%9D) is sort of a staple in West Michigan. It has been around since the 1960’s and at one point had many locations. These days there are only two locations that remain and luckily for me one is about five minutes from my office. I haven’t been to a Village Inn in well over 10 years. Growing up, the Muskegon location was the go to place for pizza and karaoke. I never went to the Holland location but the one in Muskegon had an interesting atmosphere. It was always dimly lit and the main seating area was a bunch of these long tables with bench seating surrounded by booths with red vinyl seats that all faced a stage.

The Holland location seemed to still have the booths but the bench seating was no more. They also have a pretty swanky bar in the middle of the place and TVs everywhere. After getting seated and ordering drinks, I hit the buffet for some food.

The buffet offered a little bit of everything including pepperoni, cheese, deluxe, meat lovers, a deep dish, and even a taco pizza. I believe there were also breadsticks, dipping sauce, and some sort of dessert pie if you wanted to change it up. During the first round I grabbed a slice of the pepperoni, a slice of the meat lovers, and a couple of the breadsticks.

It was love at first bite. The hand tossed style was just thick enough so the crust wasn’t crispy. The meat was cooked to pretty well done but not burnt. The cheese was cooked perfectly and the edge of the crust was sprinkled with some sort of cheese that was the icing on the cake.

The second time around I grabbed another slice of the meat lovers and a slice of the “deep dish” along with a couple more bread sticks. The deep dish was a bit of a letdown as it was basically a thicker version of the pan style. The menu says they offer Chicago-style deep dish and if this was their version of that, I would opt for the hand tossed or original. Even though it wasn’t very authentic it was still very good.

It seems at some point ([possibly even recently)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97rz6Im3ltQ) [Village Inn](http://%E2%80%9D) changed their theme from pizza parlor to sports bar. I suppose after downsizing at some point it was time for a change. Regardless I was very impressed. Its unfortunate the karaoke is gone but pizza remains in full effect and the memories I had of the one in Muskegon will last forever.

Final Rating: 3 slices
