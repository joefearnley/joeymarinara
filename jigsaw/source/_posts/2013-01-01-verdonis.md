Well my weekend pizza extravaganza didn’t end at [Top Shelf](http://joeymarinara.com/post/39438321746/top-shelf-pizza-pub). I actually tried to coordinate plans with Jason on Saturday to get some “pizza or wings and beer or something”. That didn’t work out so we talked about getting together the next day. When I came into town originally I noticed that the spot where [Tony’s Bistro](http://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-bistro-muskegon) used to be was something different now. I brought it up in conversation later and apparently the place has been there for almost two years and is called [Verdoni’s](http://www.verdonis.com/). And I was told about it on multiple occasions. Regardless, Rachel and I made plans to have lunch there the next day.

In the meantime I did a little research on the place and come to find out they offer wood-fired pizzas. They also have a variety of Italian dishes including pasta dishes, salads and sandwiches. I was stuck on the pizza though. Just after noon we headed over to the restaurant.

Once there, we walked in and requested a table in the dining area. We had the option for the bar area but it seemed to be full at the moment. I also noticed they had a bar that surrounded the main pizza oven which looking back I wish I would have choose to sit at but ultimately ended up in a booth. The waitress informed us this it being a Sunday they had some sort of happy hour specials going on. None sounded very appealing except of course the dollar off the beers at which point I ordered a pint. They also had a bloody mary bar going on that looked really good. I’m not a bloody mary guy I would have ordered one just for the presentation.

Eventually Jason showed up and we decided on what we were going to order. They had bunch of different specialty pizzas that came in 12 or 16 inches. Then of course you could create your own. Rachel ordered a steak salad of some sort. Jason and I split at 16-inch SKEE-TOWN which consisted of red sauce, ham, pepperoni, sausage, bacon, salami, brick cheese and asiago and waited patiently until it came out.

The first thing I noticed about the pie was the crust. The wood-fired pizzas I’ve had in the past always come with a really thin crust (although only ever offered in one size). That didn’t seem to be the case with Verdoni’s. It was a little thicker and I liked it. After digging into the first slice Jason mentioned the lack of sauce on the pizza. This was true, there wasn’t much sauce, if any on it. It didn’t seem to bother me much as the amount of meat and cheese on the pie made up for it. Also the crust was little overdone on the bottom but again, with the quality of the meats involved this didn’t bother me either.

I’m definitely going to make Verdoni’s a list topper for future dining options in Muskegon. The place was very nice, the wait staff was great and the dish offering was plentiful. I know for sure the next time I am there I am either going to get a different specialty pizza or the Italian hoagie. I caught some of the waitresses delivering other sandwiches and they looked very good. If you are ever on the lakeshore and looking for a great dining experience, I would check out Verdoni’s. You won’t be disappointed.

Final Rating: 4 slices
