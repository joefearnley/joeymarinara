So now that Mario is heading out of town for good, he had an idea for one last marketing action to try and sell some albums and/or get more people to [listen to it](http://protectedleft.bandcamp.com/album/posteritys-sake). We had a little money left over from the merchandise bin so we decided to get together, order some pizza and try and make a music video. The idea was a simple but a pretty one. Basically, we would film a record playing on a turntable while a party was going on and a song would be playing over the top of it. I mean, it sounded cool, but we really only had one shot to pull it off, so we got the props ready and gave it a go.

While getting everything ready, we needed to decide where to order the pizza from. I was trying to think of some places in the area that would deliver but nothing was really standing out. The three or four times we played at Mulligan’s we would always hit up Geno’s before heading home so at this point it seemed fitting. We ordered up a one with pepperoni, ham and bacon (a meat trio) and one with pineapple, green olives and onions for the vegetarians. Jason grabbed the money and headed to pick it up along with some more beer.

Twenty minutes he showed up with the pies and a six pack of Sierra Nevada Celebration ale. We popped the boxes open and went to town. The first thing I noticed was the slices were a lot smaller than what I’ve had from Geno’s. Well that was because we ordered two mediums as opposed to the extra larges that was had previously. All in all, the pizza pretty much tasted the same. The crust was thin and crispy and the sauce was typical marinara. The main reason I wanted to write this was to point out how bad the bacon was. It was real fatty and didn’t have taste. Jason even mistook it for onion when he took a bite. This was the first time I’ve ever been bummed out about bacon.

We finally got around to filming the video. Like I mentioned above we had one chance to get it right and kind of failed. It was last minute and we did the best with what we had. Regardless our stomachs were full and we made one hell of a mess. So go listen to the new protected left record and give Geno’s a try sometime but whatever you do, don’t order bacon on it.
