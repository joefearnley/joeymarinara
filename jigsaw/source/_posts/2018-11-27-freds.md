A few weeks ago I caught wind that a comedian I liked was coming to Grand Rapids. After confirming with Ray I went ahead and bought tickets to see [the fitz dog](https://gregfitzsimmons.com/) and invited a couple of friends. One of those was my buddy Craig and his wife. He lives in GR and invited us over for dinner beforehand. After finalizing logistics and times, he said he'd pick up some pizza from this place his frequents called [Fred's](https://fredssportsbar.com/).

[Fred's](https://fredssportsbar.com/ is located on Plainfield Ave. in Grand Rapids and accoring to [its website](https://fredssportsbar.com/about-us) has been around since the early 1960's and is somewhat of a staple in the area. Craig said they get lunch for work regulary here and the owners are usually there when they go to pick it up. From what I can tell is that they offer just about any Italian dish you could want as well as some American fare. The confusing part is that they have [three](https://fredssportsbar.com/) [different](https://www.fredsitalianrestaurant.com/) [websites](https://fredsitalian.net/) that all have somewhere different menus.

Craig ended up picking up a one pepperoni pie and one meat lovers.

In a pinch [Famous Famigliaâ€™s](https://famousfamiglia.com/) is a very good option. According to their website they are located mostly in malls and airports. Airport food sucks for the most part but if you stumble upon one of these and your only other option is the big fast food chains I would say you should check them out.

Final Rating: 3 slices
