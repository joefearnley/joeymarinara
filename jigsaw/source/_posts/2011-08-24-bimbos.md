Well, hockey (my men’s hockey league that is) is officially over and my Sunday nights are now free. This means no rockin’ pool parties with beer and Early Times then having to go play a game. Actually it pretty much means the same thing except I don’t have to go play hockey. Party!! This also means no more free pizza after my games because of so much ass kicking. That’s right, I now have to buy my own.

It’s okay though, I really haven’t had a free Sunday like this since the fall season began last October. I was doing some work around the house, the hunger was creepin’ and all I could think about was pizza. I have a list of places around town I want to try and review so I called a couple, no dice, then [Bimbo’s](http://www.bimbospizza.com/) answered the phone and took my order. Large cheese and pepperoni for takeout.

At first, I was a little hesitant. I have had [Bimbo’s](http://www.bimbospizza.com/) before dining in at the restuarant in downtown Kalamazoo and I have the the experience was bad. It was slow, there was one lady working, and the service was god awful. Needless to say it wasn’t enough to have me back regardless of the taste. This particular afternoon I figured what the hell, let’s give it another shot. So I ordered it up (without realizing they actually deliver with this [funny-looking, old-timey](https://s-hphotos-iad1.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/313128_10150325742357485_170824182484_8110795_2125130390_n.jpg) car that I happened to get right behind the following day) and picked it up twenty minutes later greeted by a staff of four at the counter. Something tells me things have changed in the last few years. That or I was there on a _really_ off day.

I got the pie home, opened it up and son of a bitch if they didn’t party cut that shit. That’s right a fourteen incher hot and ready to go. I’d be lying if I didn’t say I was drooling just looking at the thing. Maybe it was the fasting or maybe it was the beer I was drinking all day. Didn’t matter, it was on.

On the the pizza. I guess I wasn’t disappointed by this pie, it just left a shit-ton to be desired. I will give the cheese and the sauce the higher ranking here but if the crust wasn’t a flowery, hardened piece of wanna-be bread, I could have rated this shit higher. Leaving your customer with white finger tips is not a way I like to go out. The combination just didn’t do it for me.

I don’t like to hate. Hell, if I could love every pizza joint I go to I would. I gave this place a second chance and it just didn’t do it for me. There’s a chance I’ll be trying Bimbo’s again in the future but I know I’m not paying for it.

Final Rating: 3 slices
