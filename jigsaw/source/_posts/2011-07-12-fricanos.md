It’s that time of year again. The heat sinks in, I turn one year older and America has their day of celebration. That’s right folks, fourth of July weekend came and went and all I have is a story about Sunday afternoon well spent. Actually I have handful of stories about the weekend but this isn’t really the platform to share them on. Just one in particular.

So here was the situation. I was recovering from my birthday hangover and all that anyone wanted to watch on TV was the crazy woman who did or did not kill her child. Regardless I was hungry for some pizza and it’s been many years since I’ve been to Fricano’s, I was in Muskegon, so I thought it was a perfect match. Except that it was Sunday and a bad weekend, but it turned out they opened at 5 p.m. So I rounded up some takers and it was off to downtown Muskegon.

Fricano’s is a West Michigan staple. I’ll spare the details about the history (you can read all about them on [their website](http://www.fricanospizza.com/)) but the cool thing about the one in Muskegon (this may be true for all, I’ve only been to one) is that you only have about six (plus or minus…I should have took a picture) choices for what pie to order. You basically point to the one you want on the paper placemat and roll with it. It’s minimalism at it’s fines…and you wonder why this place has been in business for so long.

I ordered the peperoni and cheese. They offer one crust and it’s extremely thin. After only nibbling on a few things throughout the day I was confident I could take in a whole pie (despite what brickroad says) and I totally accomplished it. I do have to say it was really hard to judge this pizza. The topping to cheese to crust ratio was stretched so thin that it was hard to tell if there was anything there at all.

I don’t know, maybe I was missing something because there was nothing here that made this any better than your random pie at the bar. Maybe it’s that people love the fact they can eat several peieces of pizza and not feel like they need to get wheeled out of the restaurant on a gurney. Regardless I am going to try the one in Kalamazoo to see if there is a difference at all. The final test for Fricano’s awaits us.
