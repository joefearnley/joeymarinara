So this past Saturday ended up being a doozy. Dave, Brandon and I hit the town and from what I remember hit up about 6 or 7 different bars once the night was over. Only to end up over on Ravin Road somewhere. All I wanted to do was hit up the Sky Deck but it just wasn’t in the cards. Oh well, there is always next summer. I don’t think that place is going anywhere. Of course before we went out we had to fill up on a good hearty meal (which actually didn’t end up being the last). We wanted to show Brando what [The Beer Exchange](http://kalamazoobeerexchange.com/) was all about so we headed downtown.

For those of you not familiar with the Beer Exchange its a bar/restaurant where the price of the beer goes up or down depending on what people are buying. Fro instance, take Bud Light. Let’s say the price of a pint is usually $4. If more people are buying Bud Light, the price will increase to $6 a pint. If no one is buying it, the price of a pint drops to $2. The price changes every 15 minutes and the actual price is different depending on the beer. Unfortunately for us, it didn’t start until like 6pm and it was only 4 at the moment.

I remembered seeing pizza served the first time I was here. I’ve only eaten here one other time in which we just ordered a bunch of appetizers. Turns out the only pizza they offer is a margherita. I’m not usually a fan of this style of pie. To be honest, I am not a fan of tomatoes on my pizza let alone whole slices. I figure that’s what the marinara is there for but this was, after all , a margherita. Regardless, the option was there so Rachel and I ended up splitting the pizza and a cheeseburger.

On to the pizza. This was your typical margherita pizza with from what I could tell a wheat crust. I am not very particular to the wheat crust. I save that for my sandwiches. I was originally going to ask the waitress if I could get some sort of meat (preferably pepperoni as Brando suggested) on it as an extra topping to beef up the protein but forgot once she came and went.

It came out fresh, covered in mozzarella, tomato, basil and I think olive oil somewhere there in the mix. The crust was little tough, but you’ll have that with the wheat. The olive oil made up for and always seem to with these style pies. At this point I was really hungry and a couple Bell’s Oracle Double IPA’s deep so really, anything would have tasted good

The beer exchange is certainly a place you have to hit up at least once for the novelty. The food is pretty good too. I probably wouldn’t order the pizza again and most likely stick with the wings. Although, from what I remember, the nachos were pretty good too. They offer main fare as well as stuff for the kiddies. Maybe next time I’ll give the meat loaf to go.
