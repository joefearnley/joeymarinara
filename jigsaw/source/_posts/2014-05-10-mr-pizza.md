The bachelor party didn’t stop at the Grand Rapids Brewing Company. After a pit stop at The Pyramid Scheme, a quick stop in a random parking garage, a comedy show featuring the great Joey Diaz, a fruity drink at T.G.I. Friday’s, and a stop at the local gentleman’s club, we all made it back to the our hotel in one piece. Well, at least those who I ended up with.

We stopped in to the hotel bar for last call and someone got the idea to order pizza. It turns out the go to late-night pizza spot for this area is none other than [Mr. Pizza](http://www.mrpizzagr.com/). I ordered up a couple of pepperoni pies as we finished our drinks then headed back to the hotel room to wait for the delivery.

The pizza arrived shortly after and we dug right in. I have to be honest; things were pretty vague at this point in the night. Actually I am surprised I actually remembered to score some pictures of the pizza at all. I do remember it being pretty good and that it did not take long for a group of dudes to take down two large pizzas in a short amount of time. Unfortunately, the pictures don’t really do it justice.

This was my first experience with [Mr. Pizza](http://www.mrpizzagr.com/). I actually had a chance to eat it before but fell asleep at a buddy’s house before it arrived and it was all gone by the time I woke up. The total was around $20 for two, one-topping pizzas, which is kind of the sweet spot for pizza delivered from a mom and pop shop. I wouldn’t seek out Mr. Pizza in the middle of the day with the plethora of option in Grand Rapids but at 2 in the morning, you can’t really go wrong.
