I forgot to bring lunch with me to work the other day and need to run out and get something. Since I basically work in an industrial park, there is not much nearby, so there is at least a five minute drive to get some food. I remember I had grabbed some coupons for Arby’s that I put in my car earlier in the week so decided to put those into action. After a little research I saw the closest Arby’s was located in a [Pilot truck stop](http://%E2%80%9D) about 5 minutes down the road.

For those of you unaware of what [Pilot](http://%E2%80%9D) is, it is a truck stop with locations all over the country. They are built for long haul truckers who need to stop and get something to eat, take a shower, or [buy giant beef jerky](https://www.flickr.com/photos/joefearnley/2673224818/). I don’t know what other partnerships Pilot has with food companies but the one near my work has an Arby’s and a Cinnabun.

When I entered the location I noticed the line for Arby’s was super long and it didn’t look like it was going any fast. As I looked around I saw that Pilot had its own food offerings. There were things like tacos, burgers, chicken tenders, and pizza. They had a deal where you could get two slices of pizza for $4.They had three different pies going that you could mix and match. $4 was cheaper than Arby’s with a coupon and the pizza looked decent, so I decided to press my luck.

I ended up going with a slice of chicken cordon bleu (chicken, ham, cheese, white sauce) and a slice of meat lovers (pepperoni, sausage, bacon). I started with the cordon bleu and after the first bite I realized I was in trouble. The cheese was hardened while the ham and chicken were dry as a bone and tough to chew. I don’t know what the white sauce was exactly but it added no flavor to the pizza.

Next was the meat lovers which was a little better, but not much. The toppings were pretty much burnt and the cheese was hardened and tough like the cordon bleu. The crust was also a little tough and I’m almost certain there was no sauce on this slice of pizza.

If you ever find yourself having making a pit stop at a Pilot I’d advise staying away from the pizza. The good thing about a Pilot is if there is not at least one other option in the location itself odds are there are one or two very close by. May you be lucky enough to find one with an Arby’s in it because who doesn’t love a good beef ‘n cheddar? Regardless, always remember to [Enjoy Arby’s](https://twitter.com/nihilist_arbys/status/819967970675933185).

Final Rating: 2 slices
