Well, as of this past week, I have been married for five years. It’s flown by. Feels like the other day we were hanging out on the roof of The Tipsy Toad gearing up for the big day. Fast forward five years and expecting a child, life is a little different now. We were overdue, it was Friday and our anniversary so Rachel and I decided to hit the town to grab something to eat.

For some reason Rachel really likes Olive Garden so this is where she choose to go. I personally don’t mind the place I just think it is way overpriced for what you get and there always seems to be riddled with characters thinking spending a special night out. And no matter what night you go there it is almost always packed. This night was no different. The hot rod convention was in Kalamazoo for the weekend and for some reason these enthusiasts enjoy the Olive Garden just as much as Rachel. When we got there the line was out the door and the parking filled with hot rods. Granted it was a Friday night so most restaurants in this area are going to be busy but we decided to go someplace else anyway.

So now, we had to decide on another restaurant. I was really hungry at this point so it didn’t really matter to me where we went. For some reason [Fieldstone Grill](http://www.millenniumrestaurants.com/fieldstone-grill/) popped into my head. I’d never been there and from what I understood was a pretty nice place. So we decided on that and drove out to Center St.

Tucked away in a strip mall that had to have been build in the early 90’s (yet revamped since), Fieldstone Grill offers a wide variety of dishes to choose from. It also offers outdoor seating this time of year and being that it was still pretty warm this is where we decided to sit. I was initially on the fence about what to order. I had a burger in mind but I soon saw that they offered pizza and I couldn’t pass up an opportunity for another review. So I ordered up the Italian and a two-hearted ale and sat patiently until our order came out.

As soon as the pizza came out I knew I messed this one up. It looked nothing the picture on the menu. The sausage looked undercooked, dried tomatoes a little too dried and the cheese just there. On top of that the flavor was non-existent. I’ve had plenty of these specialty personal pizzas before and this had to have been the worse. I ended up taking most of it down but that was only because I was so hungry.

I wish I could have done this one over. If I did I wouldn’t be writing this because I wouldn’t have went with the pizza. I would have opted for the lemon chicken or steak. All in all, I think this place is a little over rated. But every place is going to have loyal customers so I don’t see it going away anytime soon. Maybe someday I’ll give it another go.

Final Rating: 2 slices
