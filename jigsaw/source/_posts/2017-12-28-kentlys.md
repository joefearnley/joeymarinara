Winter has finally reared its ugly head around these parts and the end of the year is quickly approaching. My plan is to start a diet at the beginning of next year so I am trying to squeeze in a few more pizza meals beforehand. Last Saturday night when deciding what to do for dinner, Ray said it was my choice. I was looking for a pizza place I have not had before and decided on a place named [Kently’s](https://www.facebook.com/Kentlys-Pizza-Subs-1569679623256130/).

I’ve had my eye on [Kently’s](https://www.facebook.com/Kentlys-Pizza-Subs-1569679623256130/) for a while. I actually tried to get them to deliver to my house a couple of months back because I couldn’t drive anywhere at the moment and got denied because I lived too far away. This time I was going to order take out. I noticed back then that they had weird hours and it was late but luckily they were still open.

[Kently’s](https://www.facebook.com/Kentlys-Pizza-Subs-1569679623256130/) is located in what you would call the downtown area of Fruitport, MI in a location that has been a few different pizza-related joints over the years. They offer pizza, subs, salads, and wings and are take-out and delivery only. I ordered a basic, 16 inch, pepperoni and cheese pie and picked it up about 15 minutes later. The inside of the building is simple with only a counter and couple of guys behind it watching TV. I paid for the pie and headed home to eat.

They make their pizza with the cheese over the toppings, which can be good at times. The crust was party cut and a bit on the soft side. The cheese was cooked well and tightened up a bit by the time I got home but was still very tasty. The pepperoni was also cooked well. It was thin and not crispy probably because it was under the cheese while being cooked. I ate about 3 or 4 pieces before I decided to throw in the towel.

[Kently’s](https://www.facebook.com/Kentlys-Pizza-Subs-1569679623256130/) is located in a good spot. There are not a lot of options for pizza in that area of Fruitport so I’m sure they get plenty of business. I thought the pizza was pretty good but Ray, like most places, did not. This means I probably won’t be eating it anytime soon (possibly ever again). Maybe if it was closer. Regardless, if you are in Fruitport and haven’t tried [Kently’s](https://www.facebook.com/Kentlys-Pizza-Subs-1569679623256130/) yet, and are looking for something different, I say got for it.
