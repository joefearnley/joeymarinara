Last weekend we took another short family vacation. We had plans to hit up Shedd Aquarium at some point over the summer but time got away from us. Instead we decided to head to Detroit to visit the new Legoland as well as the aquarium that is located in the same outlet mall. We’ve been planning the weekend for a while and everyone was excited.

Legoland and the aquarium were both really neat and after several hours at the mall and a nap by both kids it was time to start thinking about dinner. The hotel was stayed at offered three free drinks at happy hour, so after taking advantage of that, I was tasked with choosing somewhere for dinner. I started looking around the area of our hotel earlier in the week for pizza joints. There was a [Buddy’s](http://www.buddyspizza.com) not far from our hotel, which I considered because of the [rave reviews on mLive](http://www.mlive.com/dining/index.ssf/2016/10/pizza_top_12.html), as well as about every chain you could think of.

A place named [Alibi](http://www.alibioftroy.com) continued to stand out to me. It had great reviews and was only about 10 minutes from our hotel. My in-laws offered to go pick up the pizza in exchange for getting deluxe toppings on half of the pie and I agreed. They ordered, went to pick it up, and returned about 20 minutes later.

I didn’t do the ordering so I was not exactly sure what going to be on the pizza. Other than onions and green peppers on half, the pizza consisted of bacon, ham, pepperoni, mushrooms, sausage, and black olives. The pizza was loaded with toppings and I wasted no time and dug right in.

This was the type of pizza you could easily eat with the knife and fork. It was a little difficult to navigate in the beginning. All I remember was a mountain of salty meat and a slightly floured crust in each bite I took. I never thought bacon and black olives would go together but in this case it was a match made in heaven. I suppose my only complaint was the mushroom (which I am not much of a fan of in the first place) were the canned kind which is a bit of a turnoff for me.

Everyone was satisfied with the decision to go with [Alibi](http://www.alibioftroy.com) (which felt good to me as I’ve had the opposite happen in the past and it didn’t go well). I think they are known for the pizza but they offer just about anything you can think of on their extended menu. I can tell you the pizza is great, though. I wish I had a bigger appetite at the time because I would have eaten more of it. If you ever find yourself in the Troy, MI area looking for a bit to eat, look past the chains and head to [Alibi](http://www.alibioftroy.com), they will suit all of your dinner needs.
