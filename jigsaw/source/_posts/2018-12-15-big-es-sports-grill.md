In a pinch [Famous Famiglia’s](https://famousfamiglia.com/) is a very good option. According to their website they are located mostly in malls and airports. Airport food sucks for the most part but if you stumble upon one of these and your only other option is the big fast food chains I would say you should check them out.

Final Rating: 3 slices
