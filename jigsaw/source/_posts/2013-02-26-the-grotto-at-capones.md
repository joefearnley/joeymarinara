Do you hear that? Wait, listen……that’s right. Nothing. That is the sound that your home makes when everyone is gone for the evening. Before I start sounding like a jaded old man let me just say my home on normal days is not complete chaos but having a little alone time once and awhile is pretty nice. Although I was left with a nice honey do list for the weekend there was no whining or crying or mandatory runs to the store. This also meant I was free to eat whatever I wanted for dinner without having to consult anyone. So of course I choose pizza and ordered it from a place I have yet to get everyone else on board with - The Grotto.

Now, I don’t think The Grotto is exactly known for their food let alone their pizza. It’s primarily known for being a college bar that I’ve actually been to once or twice but have never had the urge to go back. That is until one day on my way home from hockey there was a billboard above Old Dog Tavern advertising chicago-style pizza. Of course I was intrigued and have been wanting to try this out for a while. Finally the day had come so I ordered up a medium chicago-style (or deep dish as the bartender referred to it as) and headed up there to drink a pint while I waited.

For those who don’t know, The Grotto is located in a stip mall across the street from WMU’s main campus. When I was in school it was actually home to Bilbo’s where I went a couple of times on a Thursday night. As soon as Bilbo’s moved out a few years back, The Grotto started to occupy the place turning it into a hotspot for the college kids in the area. I watched one of the many TVs on the wall while I waited for my pie to cook. My total with the beer was around $20. I paid my tab and headed home to pig out.

I got home and went straight to the living room. I opened the box and pulled a slice out. This indeed was a deep dish pizza. After just putting the slice on my plate I began to try and get my head around how I was going to eat all of this. This was the type of pizza you had to eat with a fork. The sauce was sweet and combined with the thickness of the bread (with a crunchy bottom) left a warm delicious taste in my mouth. There seemed to be the right amount of cheese on the pie as well. Although I could always go for more cheese. The next day I warmed a slice up for lunch and noticed there was a bit more cheese than I originally saw and/or tasted. In the end I took in half of the total pizza leaving the remainder for another time.

I have no idea what else The Grotto offers as far as their menu is concerned. I was only looking for the pizza on this occasion. I did see they offered pizza with a thinner crust which could be an option for some. They do have outdoor seating in the summer if that is what you are into. I think once the summer rolls around I’ll swing in there again or once the NHL playoffs start head up there for a game. Pizza and hockey, it doesn’t get much better than that.

Final Rating: 4 slices
