A while ago a friend of mine asked me how I liked working in Grand Haven. I told them most of the year it is great but in the summer, when you go outside, you are surrounded by a ton of people on vacation roaming the streets without a care in the world, which can get a little annoying. Plus the weather has been awesome these last couple of weeks in West Michigan. In my office, my desk faces the Grand Haven pier and the more and more you look out it, the more you want to go out and play.

Earlier this week, my coworker and I decided to head out and grab some lunch. The go to spot is Deelite but I have been eying this pizza place named [Wanda’s](#%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.thewanderingcow.com/pizza/%E2%80%9D) that opened earlier this summer and have yet to check out. I suggested it, and was agreed upon so we headed out to grab some slices.

[Wanda’s Slice Barn](#%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.thewanderingcow.com/pizza/%E2%80%9D) is located at the Chinook Pier in Grand Haven. It occupies what was formerly Sam’s Taco’s who, as of about a year ago, moved to a location out by the highway. From what I can tell it is associated with a place name [The Wandering Cow](#%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.thewanderingcow.com/%E2%80%9D) which sells ice cream in a mobile truck in Grand Haven as well as a brick and mortar location in East Grand Rapids. They offer pizza by the whole and by the slice in various forms including the basics as well as specialty pizzas including loaded potato, sriracha chicken, and something called Pig Out.

On this particular day they had a supreme, cheese, and meat lovers available. I ordered a slice of the meat lovers and one cheese. The pies were already made up but cooked to order which was nice but there was a 10 minute wait. After waiting outside for the slices to cook, we headed around back to find a spot to eat. We grabbed a spot by the channel under and tree and dug in.

The cheese slice was cooked about the best you could. The crust was doughy enough that you could get a good fold going with the size of the slice. The meat on the meat lover’s slice added all kinds of flavor to the pizza and the sauce was pretty basic but didn’t take anything away from it. Two slices was a perfect match for lunch.

I have to say, cooked to order is the way to go with any pizza and places offering pizza by the slice rarely do this. I think [Wanda’s](#%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.thewanderingcow.com/pizza/%E2%80%9D) has some staying power and hope they are around for a long time. Specialty pizza by the slice in that area is such a great idea. If you are ever down near the Grand Haven channel a need a quick bite, I highly suggest checking our Wanda’s. If pizza is not your thing, they also offer salads, wings, and breadsticks, so get on it.

Final Rating: 4 slices
