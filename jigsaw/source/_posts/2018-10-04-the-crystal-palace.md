At this point we’ve survived four days at Disney World. I use the term “survive” not to make it sound like I am having a terrible time but with the combination of heat, time lines, lack of sleep, confusion, there are times where I get a little lost. Regardless, we have to forge on (did I mention it’s hot here) and get to that next breakfast.

On this particular morning, we had a reservation at this place called the [The Crystal Palace](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/dining/magic-kingdom/crystal-palace/) that is located in the Magic Kingdo. I think the name comes from the fact that the building was like an atrium with glass ceilings and a very open concept. They served breakfast buffet style so after a couple of different passes by it and finally getting seated we decided to make a go at it. We got the kids situated on the first round and I picked up some eggs and bacon on the first round. Combine that with some coffee and I would be good to go for the remainder of the morning.

One of the boys wanted to go up for a second round so I decided to join them. After passing the waffles and pancakes I noticed some sort of breakfast pizza near the end. I grabbed a couple of slices along with some assorted cheese and headed back to the table. Unfortunately the pizza had been sitting out for a while and was almost cold. It was more or less a quiche with cheese, onions, and green peppers which I wouldn’t have on an omelette let alone a pizza. I think I managed to get through half a slice and gave up. I’ve never had a breakfast pizza that I’ve liked and this one didn’t change anything for me.

At this point in the trip I was basically just along for the ride. We’d been through a lot of emotional ups and downs but overall it was a fun trip so far. I mean, if over-priced buffets combined with a little character interaction is your thing I’d suggest hitting up [The Crystal Palace](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/dining/magic-kingdom/crystal-palace/) for at least one meal. And if you do go, I’d suggest staying away from the breakfast pizza.

Final Rating: 2 slices
