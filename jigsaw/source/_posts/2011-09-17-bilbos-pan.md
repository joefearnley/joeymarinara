Well after one hell of a weekend I was already in the mood for pizza again. Dave brought up the idea of hitting up [Bilbo’s](http://bilbospizza.com/) again as they have a special on Tuesday’s (or is it Monday’s? Doesn’t matter). It’s called “The Family Special” where you get a large pizza …… I ’ve wanted to check their pan pizza for a while as all I ever get when I go is the stuffed pie. We finalized the plans and headed on over.

I’ve [complained about the service before](http://joeymarinara.com/post/4379752246/bilbos) at Bilbo’s and tonight seemed a little better. It seemed everyone at the table was a little worn out from the weekend reminiscing about how things got a little loose. We ordered a couple of beers and the family special while continuing on our conversation.

The pizza came out nice and hot. I would say there was anything special about it other than if you like thick, pan style you would enjoy this. The crust was a little too doughy for me but the cheese and sauce evened things out. After two slices and a couple of beers my stomach was becoming full. I added another half slice and threw in the towel.

Being my second time reviewing Bilbo’s I do have to say the service was better. As for the pizza I plan to stick to the stuffed pie and do away with the break sticks. If there is one thing this world needs its another pan pizza. I know I’ve certainly had better.

Final Rating: 3 slices
