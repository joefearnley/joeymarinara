Working in downtown Grand Haven has its perks. There are several bars and restaurants, shopping, candy, and if you are up for the going a little further, even on of the most beautiful beaches on the Great Lakes. In my particular building alone, there is a microbrew pub, coffee shop, wine tasting room, and a restaurant. Needless to say, I don’t have to go far to get something I want.

Earlier this week, the weather was pretty drab, rain and all. Kevin (boss and co-worker) and I decided to order a pizza from the restaurant downstairs named [Portobellos](#%E2%80%9Dhttp://enjoyportobello.com/%E2%80%9D). It is located in the old piano factory in downtown Grand Haven. The serve up mainly Italian dishes but also have salads, sandwiches, and pizza.

Kevin likes to order this pie he refers to as “just meat”. Basically all of the meats they offer on pizza including pepperoni, sausage, ham, and meatball. They only offer a 14 incher so we ordered one up and picked up 15 minutes later.

We brought it back up to the office, fresh out of the oven. The cheese was plentiful, which it was I thought really made the pizza taste come out. The curst was soft and chewy. There was not much sauce on the pie, just enough. That didn’t matter because the meat combination made up for it. They were all cooked well and added some salty greasy tastes that lit my taste buds right up. I’ve never had meatballs on my pizza and I am certainly a fan now.

[Portobellos](#%E2%80%9Dhttp://enjoyportobello.com/%E2%80%9D) is somewhat of a staple along the lakeshore. If you live anywhere in the area odds are you have been there before. If you have not I highly suggest checking it out. The food is great and the atmosphere is even better. In the summer they have outdoor seating and ,what is probably unbeknownst to most, in the winter during happy on Fridays, they have a discount on drinks and free pizza. If you don’t know, know you know.

Final Rating: 4 slices
