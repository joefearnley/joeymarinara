Saturday morning round two of the bachelor party finally began. Once we finally decided on who was going to drive it was off to D-town for the night. I had a light breakfast with plans to grab some lunch when we get into town. Jason and I researched pizza joints a few days prior. Now I am not going to go into details about it but after reading the reviews about [Supino Pizzeria](http://supinopizzeria.com/) in the Eastern Market we were sold. Once we rolled into town we found a parking place and wondered in.

The restaurant itself was neat and really small. There is limited seating and on this particular day the market area was pretty busy and there was a line out the door. We ordered a large pepperoni and headed over to [Vivio’s](http://viviosbloodymary.com/) to kill some time because we had about an hour until the pizza was ready and the second group of dudes hadn’t arrived yet. After a couple of beers (some of us chose the bloddy mary) we got the call that the pie was ready.

We really didn’t have a place to sit in the restaurant and I couldn’t talk the waitress at Vivio’s to let us bring it in there so we set it on the hood of the car and popped the box open. There it was…18 inches of cheesy pepperoni New York style goodness. The pizza had it all. Fresh mozzarella, pepperoni and tasty, crispy crust. The slices were so big I could only take in two after pretty much not eating at all day. I can’t say that I would go as far as the guy who reviewed this place on Yelp but it was damn good.

I am more of a fan of Chicago style otherwise this place probably would have ranked a little higher for me. I would suggest anyone in the Detroit area give it a shot if they get the chance. Actually I would suggest just checking out the Eastern Market period. It’s a neat part of town that for some reason I have never been to and will make sure to check out again the next time I am back.

Final Rating: 4 slices
