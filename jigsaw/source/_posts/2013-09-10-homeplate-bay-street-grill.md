So I think I got the eastern Massachusetts accent figured out. Basically, it translates to a midwestern accent like this:

*   Ar -> ah
*   Ah -> aw
*   Er -> uh
*   Ure -> ore

Like I mentioned in my last post, the restaurants were pretty limited in the area we were staying at. One of the only bar and grille’s in the area was a place called [Homeplate](http://www.homeplate.us.com/). It was a typical sports bar.

[Homeplate](http://www.homeplate.us.com/) also happened to be a customer of the company we acquired (so our customer now). While we were there they catered a couple of lunches over the weekend while employees were going through some training in the office. Needless to say I got a custom to their cuisine by the time I left.

On one of the last nights we were there, we had a long day and another early morning to be back in the office. So once again we ended up back at home plate. At this point, other than the pizza, I had only tried the wings from there. I was debating between a different type of pizza or the stuffed burger. I don’t know why, but the stuffed burger seemed a little much at the time. I ended up going with a chicken bacon ranch personal pie and a can of this IPA they call [Green Monsta.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/joefearnley/9572089330/in/photostream/)

The pizza came out shortly there after. I was starving at this point and dug right in. It was hot but I didn’t care. The way the curst, cheese and bacon all melted together was like a blessing in my mouth. The chicken and ranch just added to the mayhem. I don’t know what it was. The crust was chewy and flavors abundant. It almost tasted like a hot sandwich you’d get but not toasted.

In the end I took down ¾ of the pie. I was debating on more but being that we had a somewhat early morning and probably wouldn’t have time to stop for breakfast I started to think ahead. I was fairly certain this stuff was going to taste pretty good at 6:00 am. In the end, I was right. I scarfed down a couple of slices first thing the next morning and felt great. A couple of hours later I was in full swing.

I have to hand to Homeplate. Each night we were there the owner of the place came out and thanked us. He was happy to have us. That makes for a great dining experience. If there is anyone in the Taunton, MA reading this that hasn’t been to Homeplate. All I can say is you’re missing out. Give it a try as soon as you can.

Final Rating: 4 Slices
