We officially survived two days in Disney World. When I was talking about this trip with a friend of mine a year ago he said something along the lines of a trip to Disney World will be the most expensive trip you don’t want to go on. At this point these words definitely hold up. One thing missing from that sentiment is it will also be the hottest trip you don’t want to go on as well because mid Florida in September is ungodly warm and humid. More on that later.

On our second day we had a big morning planned. We had reservations at the castle for breakfast with the princesses. This was a really fun experience where the boys got to interact with the princesses and we were served some delicious food. After breakfast we hit a bunch of rides including Space Mountain, the tea cups, a toy story shoot ‘em up game, and A Small World. Before we knew it, it was lunch time. We spotted a place right ahead of us called [The Pinocchio Village Haus](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/dining/magic-kingdom/pinocchio-village-haus/).

The Pinocchio Village Haus describes itself as basically an Itailian joint. I had to take one of the boys to the bathroom so Ray went in to order and grab us a seat. It had cafeteria style seating and where you order at one spot and find your own place to eat. Ray ordered me a flatbread pizza along with everyone else’s order and I grabbed a table.

Like I mentioned the pizza was a flatbread style with pepperoni and sausage and was cut into four large slices. The crust’s edge had a nice crispy finish to it and the middle was pretty soft. The bread to cheese ratio was certainly a little off but I feel like that is the usual thing with flatbreads. I was hungry at this point in the day and ended up polishing off the whole thing and was ready for more rides.

All in all, [The Pinocchio Village Haus](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/dining/magic-kingdom/pinocchio-village-haus/) was a pretty run of the mill place for Disney. Like most of the food places it was busy as hell during lunch time but the food came out at a good pace. I wouldn’t go running to seek this place out by any means but in the middle of mostly hotdogs and hamburgers it is a nice change of pace, especially if you are in a time crunch.

Final Rating: 3 slices
