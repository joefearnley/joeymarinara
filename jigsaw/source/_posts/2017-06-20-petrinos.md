After not going out to lunch during the week for a few months the other day I decided to splurge and head out for some pizza. I’ve been checking out some of the local spots to see what is out there. One place I had driven by was named [Petrino’s](http://%E2%80%9D) on the southside of Holland not far from downtown. I noticed they had a sign in the window that read “Pizza by the Slice” so when my hunger pains started to kick in I headtoward downtown.

[Petrino’s](http://%E2%80%9D) has multiple locations around Holland. Or at least I think they do. According to [their website](http://%E2%80%9D) there are two locations: one Holland and one in Zeeland. The confusing thing is, one of the locations in Holland is actually named _Don_ Petrino’s. Regardless all locations offer pizza, stromboli, subs, salads, and pasta.

The location I went to is located is when looks like a house in a small business district. When I arrived they had a couple of pies in the rotator – a meat lovers and a deluxe – along with a couple orphan slices. They had a deal going on where for $5 you get two slices of pizza and a drink. I ordered two slices of the pepperoni, sausage, and bacon along with a can of Diet Coke.

After adding a little red pepper to the slices I found a see and started eating. The pizza was fresh. So fresh that it burned the roof of my mouth a little bit. After letting it cool down a bit I started back up. The first thing I noticed was the crust. For as big as the slices were, the crust was still crispy on the bottom, giving it a little crunch when you bit in. The combination of the cheese and meat gave it that oily, greasy flavor that I love on pizza. I even had to give the slices a fold at the beginning to get a good bite. After two slices I was plenty full.

[Petrino’s](http://%E2%80%9D) has a lot of potential. The location I visited was newly renovated with plenty of seating which is good because it was pretty full for a Wednesday. With the plethora of pizza options in the Holland area, [Petrino’s](http://%E2%80%9D) should not be overlooked. They offer great, New York style pizza for a decent price. You can’t find just anywhere.

Final Rating: 4 slices
