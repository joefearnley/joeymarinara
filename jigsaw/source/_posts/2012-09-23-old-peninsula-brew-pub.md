With the summer winding down but the weather still fantastic and neither Rachel or I looking to cook, we started discussing where we wanted to dine on this particular Tuesday night. I started thinking about the places we haven’t been in a while. I started thinking about the downtown options and eventually came to the conclusion that I haven’t been to [Olde Peninsula](http://oldepenkazoo.com/) in a quite some time. There were a couple of other options thrown in but my mind was made up, O.P. it was.

For those of you who are unaware, Olde Peninsula is located in the heart of downtown Kalamazoo. They have been around forever, brew their own beer, and offer a somewhat unique menu, officially dubbed a “Brewpub and Restaurant”. I have to be honest, I’ve eaten here many times (even have one of their growlers sitting in my basement I think) but have never been a fan of their food. They do offer your run of the mill bar food so there is always some to fall back on but unfortunately the dishes I feel they want to be known for don’t really do it for me.

Regardless of what I like on the menu there is always pizza. Something I didn’t realize O.P. even offered. I guess it’s not something I think of when in a place like this. Regardless, I checked them out. The 9 inch offers included vegetarian, chicken alfredo, barbecue, and assorted cheese. The barbecue chicken, even though a little much for pizza, looked like the best option as far as I was concerned. I ordered one up along with an OP IPA and the waiter went on his way.

One the pizza arrived, I was reassured that it was indeed a little much. It came loaded with bacon, chicken, a couple of different cheeses and barbecue sauce. The sauce was very noticeable, probably more than anything on the pie. It had a sweet taste and it appears is made with beer (thus the name Beer-B-Que). The cheese was a little over done. If there is one thing I like on my pie it’s good melted cheese. This combination of cheddar and monterey jack just didn’t do it for me. The crust was alright, a little doughy for me. Then of course there was bacon. You can never go wrong with bacon.

I don’t know if I would ever order the pizza again at O.P. If I would I would try one of the different offerings. You can’t go wrong with the beer though. If you are ever making your rounds in downtown Kalamazoo be sure to stop in to O.P. for a pint. Then don’t be afraid to head to Winston’s next door for desert.
