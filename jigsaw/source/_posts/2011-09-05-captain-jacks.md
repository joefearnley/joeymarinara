So I guess summer is almost over. I know I had one hell of one. If this past weekend was a way to say goodbye to it, I’d say we did it in great fashion. In Muskegon none the less. Friday night we hit a beer tent and finished at the Sand Bar. Saturday was tubing all day on the river and a pool party/cookout later on in the evening. So what should we do on Sunday? Well the sun is still shining and I didn’t have to work on Monday. We decided to hit the beach and pack a cooler.

We decided on [Pere Marquette](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pere_Marquette_Beach) as the spot for the day. It seemed abnormally windy that day and the beers were flowing. We spent a couple hours on the beach and then decided to hit up [Captain Jack’s](http://www.myspace.com/captainjacksonthebeach) for some lunch and a couple more brew dogs. Part of the trouble was finding shoes for everyone to get into the place. Dan ended up with Craig’s dress shoes which made this venture a funny from the get go.

I’ve only been to this place a handful of times. Since moving out of Muskegon right after turning twenty-one and it only being open a few months out of the year it’s one of the last choices to hit on a night out when in town. This particular afternoon was a pleasant one. We sat out on the deck while a one-man band did his thing a few feet away. The guy didn’t know and Bruce Springsteen but the menu did offer five-dollar pizza pies. We ordered up a couple along with a few more beers.

Unfortunately, there isn’t much to say about the pizza. A five-dollar pizza is a five-dollar pizza anyway you slice it. (heeyoooo!). It was the typical situation where I think they put it on the menu just to have it. Cardboard crust, generic meats and way too much cheese. I only had a few slices which was a good way to save room for the fast food consumed around 2 a.m. after hanging out at MiBar afterward.

I’d certainly go back to Captain Jack’s again, but probably won’t order the pizza. Maybe try something else on the menu. While we were there a guy next to us asked if the pizza was worth the five dollars. I replied with “Yes, but not a penny more.”

Final Rating: 2 slices
