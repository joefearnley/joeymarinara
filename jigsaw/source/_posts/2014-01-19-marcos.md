My current gig in Grand Rapids is starting to wind down. I have a couple of weeks left so I decided to make sure I check out a few more pizza spots around the area before I’m out of here. I feel like I’ve exhausted most of the mom and pop shops around the area that offered pizza by the slice. There are a few chains in the area and one in particular, [Marco’s](http://www.marcos.com/), offers slices at lunch time. I was in a bit of a hurry so I decided to head down the road and pick a couple up for lunch.

I’m not sure what the story is with Marco’s. According to [their facebook page](#%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.facebook.com/MarcosPizza/info%E2%80%9D), the company was started in Teledo, OH in the late 70’s and grew into a frahise years later. I’ve seen a few around West Michigan but never gave it a try. Today was that day.

Inside the location I went to, it reminded me of the typical chain pizza joint. A bunch of people working the back, smell of parmesan in the air, and way more than just pizza to choose from on the menu. They were offering a lunch special. Something like $4 for 2 slices of pepperoni. I went with that option and headed back to the office to chow down.

The slices were fairly small compared to what you normally get around the area for a lunchtime deal. The dough was soft and sort of thick and there was not much sauce to work with. I was very hungry at the time so I ate the slices up super fast without much recollection of the taste. All I know is that it was good and reminded me a lot of Papa John’s.

I’d suggest giving [Marco’s](http://www.marcos.com/) a try if you haven’t. There is nothing you’ll be blown away with but if you have a coupon and are looking to switch things up, go with Marco’s. You may only be slightly disappointed.

Final Rating: 3 slices
