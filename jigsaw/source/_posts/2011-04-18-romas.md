Just when you think spring is here mother nature brings out that big claw and lets you know what time it is. It’s the middle of April and it’s snowing. I had a few beers early in the day during the Red Wings game and nothing was sounding better than pizza. Looking at the options we decided to go with [Roma’s](http://www.romaspizzakzoo.com/).

I’ve never actually had the pizza from Roma’s. Rachel and I always opt for the calzones since we used to live a block from the place years ago. It came in a generic pizza box that looked very similar to those flying around Mario’s place a couple of weeks back. This time though the box was full and the smell was amazing. There was a deal for a large one topping and bread sticks for $10.99 so we went for it.

The pizza was really good. We chose pepperoni for the topping and don’t think it was a bad choice. I think the crust was the only thing lacking, comparable to Little Caesar’s. As for the bread sticks I would opt out of the choice next time. I took down three slices once was all said and done and that sounds like a good number.
