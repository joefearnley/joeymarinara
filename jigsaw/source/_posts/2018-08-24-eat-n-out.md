[As I mentioned in the last post,](http://joeymarinara.com/post/179217132129/basil-leaf-pizza) I was at a conference last weekend. When the first day wrapped the attendees were on our own for dinner. I originally had plans to eat with some people I had met that day but after I went back to my room I couldn’t find them and didn’t have their numbers so I was basically on my own. I set out on the main drag to find a place to eat.

I had been munching on snacks all day so I wasn’t that hungry so I didn’t want some big, sit-down meal. I was hoping for something a bit on the lighter side. I know there was a place in the casino that sold small sandwiches and pizza by the slice so that could be my fallback if I couldn’t find anything. After a walk down to T Old Shillelagh for a beer, a place named [Eat-N-Out Pizza & Gelato](https://www.eat-n-outpizzagelato.com/) caught my eye. After looking of the menu outside I headed in to see what it was all about.

What I found inside was not surprising at all – pizza and gelato. There were a couple of pizzas ready and I grabbed a couple slices of the pepperoni. The total was somewhere around $4. I threw some parmesan on the slices and looked for a place to sit down. Seating is pretty limited inside and I noticed a few high tables outside on the sidewalk. It was a warm night outside so I headed out and set up shop.

The slices were pretty good size. The crust was thin and buttery and with its size made for a nice, New York-style slice. There wasn’t anything cheesy about this pizza as it had been cooked pretty well and most of it had tightened up. The pepperoni was pretty typical with a couple of the pieces on the crispy side. I took down both slices, crust and all. Honestly the crust was the best part.

[Eat-N-Out Pizza & Gelato](https://www.eat-n-outpizzagelato.com/) is a great place to go if you want to grab a quick slice. It was certainly the right amount of food at the right price for me before I hit the mixer back at the hotel. With all of the higher-end restaurants surrounding it, [Eat-N-Out Pizza & Gelato](https://www.eat-n-outpizzagelato.com/) gets a little lost, but if you are looking for something cheap and quick, this is the place.

Final Rating: 4 slices
