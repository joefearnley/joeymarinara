Last week a colleague and team member of mine had her last day at the job so we decided to do something as a team for the occasion. We first talked about doing a lunch together but that eventually turned into a late lunch/happy hour. This also resulted in a location change and it eventually landed on a place named [Midici](http://www.mymidici.com/).

[Midici](http://www.mymidici.com/), which dubs itself “The Neapolitan Pizza Company”, specializes in just that - [Neapolitan Pizza.](#%E2%80%9Dhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neapolitan_pizza%E2%80%9D). There are many locations throughout the country but this one is the only in Michigan. The claim to use the freshest ingredients they can while providing the best taste. The place is simple in the fact that they pretty much only serve pizza but complex in the fact that they have a very large menu with about every configuration of pizza you can imagine.

The inside of the restaurant is pretty fancy. They have an open kitchen and make the pizza in a Subway or Qdoba style in that they make the them in front of you behind a piece of glass and then throw them in a bedazzled, wood-fired oven to cook. They cook really fast so you don’t have to wait very long. They also have a small bar with old-timey movies playing on the wall. They don’t have servers like your typical restaurant so you have to order your food and drinks at the counter.

Initially we ordered some drinks and a meat and cheese board. The board consisted of a variety of meat and cheeses along with some slices of bread with drizzle and some mustards to spread. There were about three different cheeses and three different meat, all Italian. There were also these tiny pickles but I didn’t get a chance to try those.

Then we ordered a bunch of different pies to shared. The first couple to come out were a pesto and Margherita. The latter was the first I tried. The first thing I noticed was the crust was very thick and the rest of the pizza was very thin. So thin that a colleague that had been to the place said they just roll the slice up around the crust and it like that. Regardless, it tasted great. The mozzarella and sauce was super fresh and the crust had a great soft baguette style flavor to it. I didn’t try the pesto as we had some pepperoni pies coming out next.

The next pie to came out was the pepperoni.The taste was very similar to the Margherita but with the added flavor of the pepperoni. They were noticibly spicy and abnormally large in diameter. I thought they added great flavor and ended up having a couple slices of it.

[Midici](http://www.mymidici.com/) is an excellent choice if you want a great pizza with quick service. I can’t attest for the cost as I didn’t pay for anything but looking at the prices on the website, they don’t seem to be too expensive. For some the amount of food you get for the price may not be enough. There are few (if any) places in the area that offered Neapolitan pizzas so if you are looking for some a little different that tastes great, I would certainly check out [Midici](Dhttp://www.mymidici.com/).

Final Rating: 4 slices
