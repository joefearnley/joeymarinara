I think it’s safe to say Canada isn’t exactly known for their pizza. Maybe more for things like bacon and poutine (which is everywhere there, [including Wendy’s](http://www.flickr.com/photos/joefearnley/8699836541/in/photostream)). I still somehow ended up eating it twice over the course of 4 days. The first was at a chain called [Boston Pizza](http://joeymarinara.com/post/49408647522/boston-pizza) which I really liked but it was a chain. Not that this entry is any different, but the second time I had pizza on my trip it was brought in by the company. So I figured I’d post about it.

Lunch was served this time by a place called [Pizza Nova](http://www.pizzanova.com/). According to their website have been around for quite some time. OK, well, it displayed all over their website as well as the box the pizza came in. Apparently they have locations all over the Toronto area. So I suppose this would be considered a chain, but I’m OK with that.

In this instance I didn’t get to choose my toppings so when I entered the lunch room I was presented with options. For the most part, things were pretty picked over by the time I got there so I had to settle with a slice of pepperoni and a couple of deluxe. I didn’t mind I was way past normal lunch time and it was free so who was I to complain.

Since we were a little late to the lunch it had been sitting out a while. The crust was a bit on the thick side and was still soft and chewy. The toppings and cheese kind of began to form together but were still edible. The sauce was put on thick and was a bit on the sweet side. This was probably the best part of the pie. After three slices and a soda I was stuffed. There wasn’t any left for me anyway so that was probably a good thing.

Pizza in Canada was a pleasant surprise. I wish we could have checked out a mom and pop shop but on a work schedule like we had it was hard to fit any like that in (although we made it a priority to stop at Five Guys at least once and The Beer Store once a day). Also, where we were staying was chocked full of chain restaurants and frankly I don’t think pizza is that popular there. Oh well, maybe next time.

Final Rating: 3 slices
