25 years is a long time. Hell, I just passed that mark in my life a few years ago and it seems like…a lifetime. Well that is how long my in-laws have been married. We went to Muskegon to celebrate it with them. Rachel’s brother was going to be in town from Colorado and we thought it would be a good idea to take them along with the rest of the family out to for dinner that Saturday night. Where to go was the big question and after it had been changed what felt like 6 times we finally settled on [The Lake House Water Front Grille](http://www.thelakehousemi.com/lake-house-home).

The Lake House is kind of a fancy joint. The only other time I had been there was for Jason and Emily’s wedding a little over a year ago. This time was obviously different. Without the ball room opened up things seemed a bit more condensed. We arrived early and got a Scarface booth next to the bar. Once the guests arrived we got vetoed and ended up at a different table. We took seat, ordered a beer and checked out the menu.

Most of the menu consisted of your typical fine dining. I did notice they offered a couple of pizza options so I suggested we get one for an appetizer. After a bit of back and forth on what we wanted for the main course we ended up ordering a Martguerita pizza for the appetizers and top that off by splitting a fillet for the main course.

The pizza came out early and they plopped it right on a pedestal in front of me. It was bigger than I thought it was going to be. I am not a huge fan of the Martguerita pizza. Maybe it just something about whole tomatoes but it’s just not my bag. Regardless I was hungry so I grabbed a slice and dug in. You could definitely taste the pesto in it. I took a some of the tomatoes off as I chipped away as they were a little much to handle. I did like the drizzle they put on the top. It gave the pie a little zest. All of that combined with a crispy crust made for a tasty pizza.

For the most part The Lake House is a little too fancy for my tastes. If I were to go again I would like to go at a warmer time of the year so I could dine outside next to the lake. If you are in the mood for a little upscale dining with a little Muskegon flavor I would suggest checking out The Lake House. You might just find something you like.

Final Rating: 3 slices
