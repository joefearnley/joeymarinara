I turned 29 over the weekend and spent Friday night in Grand Rapids with some friends. Jason’s band played at a recently opened venue downtown called The Pyramid Scheme. It’s a pretty cool place with a nice bar in the front and a nice-size room in the back where bands play. The bar has several pinball machines and jukebox from the early 90’s that plays three songs for a buck and has those plastic flaps that you navigate through with a forward and backward button. A little refreshing compared to the buck-per-play digital deals that have these days.

We pounded down a shit load of Black Label’s throughout the night and at one point some dude came through the door with a pile of mini pizza boxes. Apparently this is some sort of normal thing in G.R. that Jason’s seen a few times. Regardless we ordered a couple and devoured them immediately. I don’t remember much of the taste, just that it wasn’t half bad. It sure was better than the vegan chicken wings I had for dinner.

Pizza aside I had a fun night. We ended up at The Meanwhile by way of Mario’s van for a night cap. I woke up a little tired but ready to take on my last year of my twenties. I’m trying to hold out from that big three oh but it’s only a matter of time.

Update: Turns out the pizza was from a place called [Vito’s](http://www.vitospizza.net/) based out of West Grand Rapids.

Final Rating: 3 slices
