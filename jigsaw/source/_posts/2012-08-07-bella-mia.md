The weather took an interesting turn for the worst this week in West Michigan. This dry and unbelievably hot summer finally brought some rain through the area. It also cooled things down considerably. I gotta be honest, I kind of like the heat. I’d take it over 65 and raining any day. Regardless I found myself at work this week with no lunch one particular day so I looked to my list of pizza places in the area and decided it was time to give another one a shot.

I ultimately decide on [Bella Mia](http://bellamiagr.com/) and from what I remember there was one on Division not too far from my office. I went to google to confirm and this is where things got a little confusing. From what I could gather there were two locations and my office was basically in the middle of them. According to the map there was one near Kentwood High School which would have been more convenient as I had another errand to run. Unfortunately there is no sign of this location on their [website](http://bellamiagr.com/) or [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bella-Mia-Pizzeria-Italian-Grill/121078621339600). Confused I just headed down Division to see what I could find.

Lone behold, after a five minute trek down the road there it was. With a pizza-by-the-slice-for-99-cents sign out from. I was stoked. The place itself is pretty small consisting of a counter to order from, a beverage cooler, and a couple of table/chair combinations. They offered slices of pepperoni for 99 cents and other options where the price went up. I didn’t know how big they were so I ordered two slices of pepperoni and one pepperoni and ham. I think my total was like 4 dollars with a can of Diet Coke. I paid for lunch and headed back to the office to eat.

The pizza was warm and super greasy. As far as I am concerned this is a good thing. You never know when ordering by the slice how long they’ve been sitting around. I have to say the pepperoni and ham slice was a lot tastier and I think that is because it was fresh. The slices were a little bigger than I expected (but not quite like [Carlo’s](http://joeymarinara.com/post/27811006752/carlos-pizza-connection)). It wasn’t very thick either and the dough was cooked to perfection. The greasy, cheesy goodness of this pizza left my taste buds totally satisfied.

After three slices of this stuff I was filled to the brim. I certainly could have gotten away with just having two. I am a creature of habit and with so many other options around this particular area I think it’s safe to say Bella Mia probably won’t be my first choice. Like most of these places around there they also offer sub sandwiches which might be worth checking some time (when I was inside ordering there was a guy eating one and it looked tasty). But if you are in a hurry and are looking for some cheap lunch you may want to consider checking this place out.

Final Rating: 3 slices
