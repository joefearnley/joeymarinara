Chicago Style Pizza‎
====================

It’s weird. Sometimes you hear of things that are almost mythical but in reality it turns out it’s a sham. That was my experience with Chicago Style Pizza in Kalamazoo. Fool me once, they may get a chance to fool me again.

I’ve only heard how unbelievably awesome this place is. Well the pizza anyway. If you can actually find this place is sort of a feat in itself. The place reminds of a concession stand at a little baseball field. They do actually have seats outside so eating there is an option. Although when inside, you are presented with really old newspaper clippings on the wall, a few things from chicago, and a pizza oven that looks like it been through the ringer.

Alright, where was I? Oh right, finding the place. It’s literally located on the other side of town (from where I live), deep in the bowels of Portage. I think this may have been a factor when eating the final product. After ordering, driving twenty minuted to find the place, stopping at the beer store, and driving another fifteen minutes back home, the pizza became a little cold. Also, the cheese started to become, as Rachel would put it, “congealed”. 

If there is one thing that we (Dave, Ashley, Rachel, and I) could agree on was the sauce was the THE SHIT! Pretty much the boss. Like to the point where Sweet Baby Ray’s should have that tagline revoked. You could tell that right out of the oven this could have been an entirely different experience. But it was what it was. Good sauce with lousy bread and cheese (no re-heat ability in the case as the participants cashed it). I really hope to give this place another shot.

Final Rating: 3 slices
