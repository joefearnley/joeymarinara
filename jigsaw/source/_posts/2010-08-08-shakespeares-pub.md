Another warm Friday night in the summer and we decided to hit up some place downtown. Outside seems to be an option for every bar or restaurant in town these days, but nothing beats getting decked at Harvey’s as far as I’m concerned. But like everything, the decision to pick a restaurant moves in waves so I was outvoted for [Shakespeare’s Pub](http://www.shakespearespub.com/). Even though the service is always somewhat lacking and they have screwed up our bill on numerous occasions, they have a great drink selection, decent food and there is always some sort of sporting event to catch there.

Shakespeare’s offer what they call “Nearly Famous Squared Pizza”. I have no idea what kind of fame this pizza has as I haven’t heard many people actually talked about it. But it certainly is square and comes in a 16 inch size. We ordered one with pepperoni. The one thing that stood out to me was the crust on this stuff. It was seasoned ever so nicely with some great spices. The four-cheese blend added some great flavor and the sauce didn’t hurt a thing. It was nice and thick (but not too thick) which caused me to fill up pretty fast.

I don’t think Shake’s (as the kids call it) is known for anything particular on its menu. I suggest the pizza to anyone going there with intentions of stuffing their face. Even splitting it with four people there will be plenty to go around. Tell them Joe sent you and I guarantee nothing but par to sub-par service. They will also look probably look at you funny as they have no idea who I am.

Final Rating: 4 slices
