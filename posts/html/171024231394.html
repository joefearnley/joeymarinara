                    <p>Last week was a short one at work and I didn’t prepare at all for lunch so decided to eat out each day. I figured if I was going to let things ride this week I might as well squeeze another pizza place. I am starting to run out of pizza places around my office and am now forced to look at other areas of Holland. Downtown has a few places that offer pizza, but not really by the slice. One of those places was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Subs-N-More/116682795058456">Subs-N-More</a>, so I decided to give it a shot.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Subs-N-More/116682795058456">Subs-N-More</a> before when I lived in downtown Kalamazoo, hitting it up on a couple of Saturdays while Ray was at work.  That location ended up <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2008/10/downtown_kalamazoo_subsnmore_r.html">closing up </a> right around the time I was living there. <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2008/10/downtown_kalamazoo_subsnmore_r.html">According to the MLive article</a> there were once 11 of these places around the area but I can’t seem to find much information about them. There was also <a href="http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2012/04/former_quiznos_shop_to_get_new.html">a location in downtown Grand Rapids a few years ago</a>  but <a href="http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2013/09/subs-n-more_closes_downtown_ne.html">it ultimately threw in the towel</a> as well. It appears the only locations I could find these days are <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Subs-N-More/116682795058456">one in Holland</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Subs-N-More-262580423808286">one in South Haven</a>.

</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Subs-N-More/116682795058456">Subs-N-More</a> is just that – a sub shop that also offers pizza, salads, and a hand full of appetizers. As for pizza, they offer full pies as well as by the slice. Because of the horrible winter weather and the traffic downtown, it took a while, but I finally made it. I ordered two slices of pepperoni along with a drink and grabbed a seat while it cooked.</p>

<p>After about 15 minutes my pizza came out and I was presented with what looked like 2, 1 and a ½ slices of pizza. I’m not sure if that is what I ordered or that is how they serve them. Granted, I didn’t pay much attention to the menu so that certainly could be the case. Regardless I dug in.</p>

<p>The pizza must have come right of the oven because it was extremely hot so it took me a while before I could take the first bite. The cheese, which was plentiful and tasty, was a little over done to the point where it was oozing off the side of the slices. The curst was soft in the middle and had a little crunch on the bottom and exposed ends. The pepperoni and sauce were about as basic as you could get. There seemed to be a lot of fluff on this pizza with not a whole lot of bite that drew me in.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I have to agree with most of the comment on Sub-N-More’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Subs-N-More/116682795058456">Facebook</a> <a href="#%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.facebook.com/Subs-N-More-262580423808286%E2%80%9D">pages </a> as far as the service was concerned there. The staff didn’t explain to me at all what I was getting when I ordered and seemed like they would have liked to be anywhere but working there at the moment. I have to say that those around me that ordered subs looked like they were getting a very good meal. With all of the options downtown Holland has for type of food <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Subs-N-More/116682795058456">Subs-N-More</a> offers, I can’t honestly suggest it to anyone and I probably won’t be back.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 2 slices</p>
