                                    <h1>The Grotto at Capone's</h1>
                    <p>Do you hear that? Wait, listen&hellip;&hellip;that&rsquo;s right. Nothing. That is the sound that your home makes when everyone is gone for the evening. Before I start sounding like a jaded old man let me just say my home on normal days is not complete chaos but having a little alone time once and awhile is pretty nice. Although I was left with a nice honey do list for the weekend there was no whining or crying or mandatory runs to the store. This also meant I was free to eat whatever I wanted for dinner without having to consult anyone. So of course I choose pizza and ordered it from a place I have yet to get everyone else on board with - The Grotto.</p>

<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t think The Grotto is exactly known for their food let alone their pizza. It&rsquo;s primarily known for being a college bar that Iâ€™ve actually been to once or twice but have never had the urge to go back. That is until one day on my way home from hockey there was a billboard above Old Dog Tavern advertising chicago-style pizza. Of course I was intrigued and have been wanting to try this out for a while. Finally the day had come so I ordered up a medium chicago-style (or deep dish as the bartender referred to it as) and headed up there to drink a pint while I waited.</p>

<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know, The Grotto is located in a stip mall across the street from WMU&rsquo;s main campus. When I was in school it was actually home to Bilbo&rsquo;s where I went a couple of times on a Thursday night. As soon as Bilbo&rsquo;s moved out a few years back, The Grotto started to occupy the place turning it into a hotspot for the college kids in the area. I watched one of the many TVs on the wall while I waited for my pie to cook. My total with the beer was around $20. I paid my tab and headed home to pig out.</p>

<p>I got home and went straight to the living room. I opened the box and pulled a slice out. This indeed was a deep dish pizza. After just putting the slice on my plate I began to try and get my head around how I was going to eat all of this. This was the type of pizza you had to eat with a fork. The sauce was sweet and combined with the thickness of the bread (with a crunchy bottom) left a warm delicious taste in my mouth. There seemed to be the right amount of cheese on the pie as well. Although I could always go for more cheese. The next day I warmed a slice up for lunch and noticed there was a bit more cheese than I originally saw and/or tasted. In the end I took in half of the total pizza leaving the remainder for another time.</p>

<p>I have no idea what else The Grotto offers as far as their menu is concerned. I was only looking for the pizza on this occasion. I did see they offered pizza with a thinner crust which could be an option for some. They do have outdoor seating in the summer if that is what you are into. I think once the summer rolls around I&rsquo;ll swing in there again or once the NHL playoffs start head up there for a game. Pizza and hockey, it doesn&rsquo;t get much better than that.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
