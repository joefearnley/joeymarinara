                    <p>Saturday morning round two of the bachelor party finally began. Once we finally decided on who was going to drive it was off to D-town for the night. I had a light breakfast with plans to grab some lunch when we get into town. Jason and I researched pizza joints a few days prior. Now I am not going to go into details about it but after reading the reviews about <a href="http://supinopizzeria.com/">Supino Pizzeria</a> in the Eastern Market we were sold. Once we rolled into town we found a parking place and wondered in.</p>
<p>The restaurant itself was neat and really small. There is limited seating and on this particular day the market area was pretty busy and there was a line out the door. We ordered a large pepperoni and headed over to <a href="http://viviosbloodymary.com/">Vivio&rsquo;s</a> to kill some time because we had about an hour until the pizza was ready and the second group of dudes hadn&rsquo;t arrived yet. After a couple of beers (some of us chose the bloddy mary) we got the call that the pie was ready.</p>
<p>We really didn&rsquo;t have a place to sit in the restaurant and I couldn&rsquo;t talk the waitress at Vivio&rsquo;s to let us bring it in there so we set it on the hood of the car and popped the box open. There it was&hellip;18 inches of cheesy pepperoni New York style goodness. The pizza had it all. Fresh mozzarella, pepperoni and tasty, crispy crust. The slices were so big I could only take in two after pretty much not eating at all day. I can&rsquo;t say that I would go as far as the guy who reviewed this place on Yelp but it was damn good.</p>

<p>I am more of a fan of Chicago style otherwise this place probably would have ranked a little higher for me. I would suggest anyone in the Detroit area give it a shot if they get the chance. Actually I would suggest just checking out the Eastern Market period. It&rsquo;s a neat part of town that for some reason I have never been to and will make sure to check out again the next time I am back.</p>
<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
