                                    <h1>Gino's in East town</h1>
                    <p>2011 is down and things over at Joey Marinara HQ are going strong. Due to some careers changes at the beginning of the year, the number of prospects for the future have grown. All I can say is expect more reviews of places around West Michigan. 2012 is going to be fun.</p>
<p>To start the year of <a href="http://protectedleft.org/" title="Protected Left">Protected Left</a> played a show at Mulligan&rsquo;s in the East Town neighborhood of Grand Rapids. It was the first show we have played since August of last year and surprisingly it went pretty well. Once all was said and done, we were surprised to learn they we got paid like sixty bucks as well as selling a few t-shirts. At two in the morning and money in the bank there was no other choice than to order a pizza. There is this place called <a href="http://www.ginospizzaeastown.com/" title="Gino's East Town">Gino&rsquo;s</a> a few blocks away so we ordered up a pizza/bread stick combination they have running as a special. Ready in ten minutes.</p>
<p>Part of the special was that you get up to four toppings. From what I remember and can make out of the pictures I took, I think we ordered black olive, green olive and onion. Maybe there was a forth, who knows. Anyway, we picked it up and headed back to Mario&rsquo;s. Now one thing I would like to point out here is how cool I found the inside of Gino&rsquo;s to be. It was the typical pizza joint with the red, green and white colors with a counter to pick up your order and two coin-operated arcade machines. One being an up right (I don&rsquo;t recall the name) and one being the table-top Pac Man. I don&rsquo;t remember if there was any seating in the inside but for some reason I found the place to be really neat.</p>
<p>We finally get back to Mario&rsquo;s and crack the sucker open. It was totally New York style. I don&rsquo;t remember what size we ordered just how big the slices with the thin crust. Now, I love me some olives and actually order them on my pizza from time to time, but onions on the other hand&hellip;just something I don&rsquo;t like in general. But after a light dinner and several drinks I didn&rsquo;t care what was in front of me. I just wanted to eat. And from what I remember it was pretty good.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had Gino&rsquo;s one other time while hanging out at Marbro&rsquo;s and I am pretty sure we ordered just pepperoni and cheese. I would like to take that route again in the future with maybe a little more sobriety involved. If you are ever in East Town and looking for some pizza I would suggest checking out Gino&rsquo;s and maybe playing a little Pac Man while you&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
