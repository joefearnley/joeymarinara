                    <p>Another Friday, another place to look for pizza for lunch. As I started searching for new options I realized I am starting to run out of pizza-by-the-slice joints in Holland. Looking over the potential places to go, the place the kept standing out to me was <a href="http://mancinosofholland.net/">Mancino’s</a>. It was not far from my office and I figured it would be fairly cheap and quick, so I called them up to see what the options were.</p>

<p><a href="http://mancinosofholland.net/">Mancino’s</a> is somewhat of a staple in Michigan. I’ve seen them all over the state and can’t seem to figure out where exactly they started. Regardless, I have never tried the place. They sell pizza, sandwiches (grinders), salads, and sides. The grinders seem to be what they are known for. I was interested in the pizza and unfortunately this location didn’t offer slices, so I ordered the 9” pie with pepperoni. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://mancinosofholland.net/">Mancino’s</a> location in Holland is right off the highway in a strip mall. It had a “hallway” feel to it with all of the booths lining the path all the way back to a small counter where you ordered and/or pick up your food. They seemed a little rushed and behind that day. After paying and waiting another 10 minutes they brought out my pizza and I headed back to the office to eat.</p>

<p>The pizza was pretty basic but very tasty. The crust was on the thinner side and had a crispy bottom. The cheese was melted nicely and the big pepperonis add a little spice to it. It was still hot from the oven which guaranteed some freshness that is always a plus. I took down most of the pie before I threw in the towel.</p>

<p>When I picked up the pizza I saw someone eating a grinder and it looked really good. I will definitely check one of those out the next time I choose <a href="http://mancinosofholland.net/">Mancino’s</a> for lunch or dinner. It looked like they always have some sort of special running whether it be a pizza or grinder. My pizza was around $6.00 and was plenty of food for one. I, for one, will certainly be back for more. </p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
