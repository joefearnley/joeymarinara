                    <p>It is my second to last day here at my current gig and I am taking a last chance effort to find some pizza joints around the area. I&rsquo;ve tried about everything I could so I started to venture out into surrounding areas. Grandville is nearby and it has a few different places that peaked my interest. After researching for a few minutes I decided on Francesco&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Francesco&rsquo;s is located on the northeast side of Grandville. When going through Grandville I am usually passing through the downtown area on my way home from work or the area around the mall, so this area in unknown to me. It&rsquo;s a little industrial and a little sparse so this place was not hard to find. After about 10 minutes of driving and missing a turn, I eventually found it.</p>

<p>Francesco&rsquo;s is your typical mom and pop pizza joint. When you walk in there is a counter that you order at, a station with red pepper, parmesan, napkins,  and a few places to sit down. I ordered up a slice of pepperoni and pepperoni/sausage which, as a deal, came with a small fountain soda. I filled up my cup, sprinkled a dusting of red pep and parm on the slices, and found a seat. </p>

<p>The first bite of the pepperoni was very good. It was fresh with the cheese melted nicely and the pepperoni a little crispy, but not burnt. The crust was thin and crispy but had a hint of doughiness to it. </p>

<p>All in all, Fransesco&rsquo;s hit the spot. I think my total was somewhere around $5 for a couple of slices and a soda. That&rsquo;s certainly enough for me. The service was friendly and fast. They also offered a variety of subs if that&rsquo;s your bag. If you ever find yourself in that part of Grandville or that end of 28th St., I would suggest stopping into Fransesco&rsquo;s for a slice. </p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
