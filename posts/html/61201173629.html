                    <p>On the second day of my west coast trip we decided to hit up Hollywood. At the last minute we tried to get tickets to a Home of the Stars tour around Beverly Hills but according to their website you have to book a day in advance. It turns out you could tickets on the spot but we booked them for the next day and decided to hit up Hollywood anyway. </p>

<p>One of the one places I wanted to visit while in Los Angeles. was Ameoba Records. For those of you who don’t know Ameoba Records is somewhat of a mecca as far as records stores go. The place was huge and unfortunately I walked out with nothing. It was a little weird I don’t remember the time where I couldn’t thumb through most of a store&rsquo;s entire vinyl offerings in a matter of an hour. Maybe I was a little overwhelmed. </p>

<p>After the record store we took a walk around the area. We headed down to Hollywood and Vine, over to the Capital Records building and stopped into a few stores. All of the this tourism was building up an appetite so we started looking for places to eat. Once back at the car we noticed a nice place across from Ameoba on Sunset that offered pizza.</p>

<p>The place was called Stella Barra and was very nice in inside. It was just before noon and the place was pretty empty. After ordering a couple of beers, we decided to get a pie. They offered all kinds of specialty pizza but we stuck with what we knew and ended up going with a pepperoni and cheese. Shortly after ordering I noticed a guy starting to swing some dough in the air. Needless to say I was getting pretty excited. </p>

<p>About 20 minutes later the pizza came out and we dug in. The waitress offered some shredded parmesan and we took her up on that. Honestly I wasn’t that hungry being that we ate a fairly large breakfast but I didn’t care at this point. This pie looked amazing and the taste totally matched that. The slices I had were covered in pepperoni. The crust was fairly thin but crunchy. The ends of the crust were a little thicker but again, a little crunchy which made for a nice conclusion to the slice. Looking back I wish I had a little extra marinara to dip it in.</p>

<p>Speaking of which the sauce this pie had on it was great. A little sweet but not too much. And it seemed they spread it out perfectly because it wasn’t overbearing but just enough. The cheese was melted perfectly. I don’t recall but I think it was a mixture of mozzarella and something else. Which it the standard for a pizza but was an excellent mix in this case.</p>

<p>Apparently there are a couple of these restaurants in Los Angeles. One where we ate in Hollywood and one in Santa Monica. For lunch they also offered a variety of salads and sandwiches. It offered a good atmosphere and the food was great. Those of you in the Hollywood area looking for a great pie should definitely check out Stella Barra some time.</p>
<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
