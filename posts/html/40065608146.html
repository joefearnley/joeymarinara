                    <p>I can honestly say that my year was pizza-packed right up until the end. I was told all week that the menu for new years eve was fondue. I was thinking about a lot while working all day and was totally looking forward to it. When I arrived back in Muskegon I was told walking tacos were now the main course for dinner and that didn&rsquo;t even include regular Frito&rsquo;s. Fondue was out. I was bummed. </p>

<p>Over the weekend I talked with my father-in-law about the pizza places in town I have tried and those I have not. I mentioned one of them on my list to try that I had not yet was <a href="http://www.bernieos.com/">Bernie O&rsquo;s</a>. He was very surprised I&rsquo;d never had it before and suggested that when time permitted we should make a run out there. He felt my pain about fondue-turned-walking-taco dinner and threw out the idea of heading out there that night. I embraced it with open arms and began to look at the menu. They offered a wide variety of different specialty pizzas including the Hot Wing (buffalo chicken), the Tater (mashed patatoes with cheese and bacon) and The Twist (which is their claim to fame) amongst many others. </p>

<p>After some discussion, we got (almost) everyone on board for pizza. Now, it was deciding on what to order. I was originally planning on a pepperoni and cheese but having so much of it over the weekend and Berni O&rsquo;s offering so many options, I starting looking elsewhere. I first was interested in the chicken wing pizza but noticed they had a more &ldquo;juiced up&rdquo; version of this called the Fire Bird. It was basically the chicken wing pie with bacon, jalapenos, and ghost chili powder. When I ordered they gave me the option of a heat, 1 - 3. I played it somewhat safe and went with a two.</p>

<p>One thing that annoyed me about the menu was that it only shows medium, large, and extra large for the sizes. No small. Then on the phone they referred to all of the sizes in inches that is no where on the menu. It was really confusing. I finally got everything ordered&hellip;a Fire Bird, Deluxe and a small, I mean medium Twist. We headed out to North Muskegon to pick it up.</p>

<p>Once home, I popped open the Fire Bird to check things out. I ended up ordering a large which was plenty of pizza. You could see the chili powder spread over the party-cut pie. After a couple of bites the heat started to kick in. Man this pizza was good. The mixture of the wing sauce with bacon and ranch made for a heck of a combination. The thing that really stood out to me was the crust. It was perfectly done. Very chewy with a lot of flavor. This combined with the heat of the peppers and chili powder had me immediately grabbing for my beer.</p>

<p>After one slice I got used to the heat. In the end I think I took down like four slices. I also tried a slice of The Twist after getting talked into it by Lexi. It certainly good, but a couple of things turned me off about it. First, it had pineapple on it. I have never been a fan of fruit on my pizza and this particular one didn&rsquo;t change for me. It also had so many different toppings on it it was hard for me to focus in on any specific taste. This is what they are known for (nationally acclaimed apparently) but it just didn&rsquo;t do it for me.</p>

<p>Bernie O&rsquo;s is definitely worth checking out if you get a chance. Offerings like The Twist take a different approach to pizza which is refreshing especially with the pizza-filled weekend I had. I wish they had another location a bit closer to my family as I&rsquo;d suggest we get this all the time. I&rsquo;d like to try the regular pepperoni next time as I don&rsquo;t think it will be as good as the Fire Bird, but my curiosity&rsquo;s got me hooked.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
