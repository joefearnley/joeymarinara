                    <p>Wow what a winter it has been. Living back in Muskegon I am fortunate to still have some friends living around town. One of them is my pal Jeff. Jeff and I were were pretty close in high school. We hung out all the time doing a lot of things that we probably shouldn’t have been doing and played hockey together.</p> 

<p>Jeff and his family built a house on a property that is on a nice little man-made lake. And with a winter like this one has been, the first thing that runs across the minds of us hockey players is that we need to flood that thing and make a rink. So, for the past couple of weeks we’ve been playing a little pond hockey with whoever wants to join us.</p>

<p>In high school, after we’d been having a good time Jeff used to fire up the grill and cook barbecue chicken. I gave him the nickname Chef Younts at one point but it never stuck. On this particular Saturday, Jeff insisted on cooking some post-game pizza. I was getting pressure from Ray to head home but I had to stick around for a slice.</p>

<p>Jeff’s pizza cooking style is all ingredients from Meijer. Simple enough for me. Pizza crust, marinara, pepperoni (none of that turkey based bullshit), cheese and italian seasoning. I can’t say for sure but I would say the pizza were 16 inches.  </p>
