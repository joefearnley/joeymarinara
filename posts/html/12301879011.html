                                    <h1>Peppino's Pizzeria & Sports Grille</h1>
                    <p>OK, so this past Wednesday has been planned for while. Me and a bunch of bros got tickets to se GWAR at The Intersection. I&rsquo;ve never been a huge fan of the band or anything but who knows how long this band will actually be around for. One of the best scenes from one of my favorite movies was when Mark ate some pot-laced (or some other drug, I&rsquo;m not sure what it was) brownies in Empire Records and GWAR started talking to him through the television. Plus Every Time I Die was playing who is one of my favorite bands to see live. So it was pretty much on.</p>

<p>The show was great and once it ended someone had the idea of hitting up <a href="http://www.peppinospizza.com/">Peppino&rsquo;s</a> for some post-game pies. I was game so off we went. Now, this is where things get a little hazy. I sort of remember high-fiving the giant dude from ETID and him commenting on how drunk I was as we left The Intersection. This couldn&rsquo;t have been good. Regardless, it was onward to pizza and more beer.</p>

<p>Upon arrival, I distinctly remember how empty the place was. Granted, it was a Wednesday night but this place smack dab downtown GR. It just seemed a little strange that the only group in the place was one that had also gone to the show. I don&rsquo;&rsquo;t remember who orded them, but after a beer and before I knew it, a couple of fresh pies came out for the grabbing. As I bit in my thoughts were &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good, it&rsquo;s greasy&rdquo; and I think that is where it stopped. I&rsquo;m not going to go into details, let&rsquo;s just say it was good.</p>

<p>And there it is. The one photograph I managed to take of the pizza. The irony here is that it&rsquo;s pretty much as mysterious as my time at Peppinoe&rsquo;s.  I certainly have to check this place out again one of the next times I am in Grand Rapids. It looks like the type of place that can get a little broed out at moments but I would like to see what the pizza tastes like under normal circumstances. As for now, I will stick with my memory.</p>

<p>(not-completely) Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
