                    <p>Once again, it&rsquo;s a Wednesday night, we&rsquo;re looking to go get something to eat and no one can decide where to go. Whenever this happens everyone pretty much ends up deciding on what&rsquo;s become known as default: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Harveys-on-the-Mall/239307885386">Harvey&rsquo;s on the Mall</a>. Well Harvey&rsquo;s to most of the world.</p>

<p>For those of you who know me know that if there was one place I would call my watering hole it would be Harvey&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ve had most most of the things on the menu by now including the pizza. The have a fancy oven in the back where they cook pizza, Stromboli and even subs I think. Some times it&rsquo;s a crap shoot with the pizza because it doesn&rsquo;t quite cook all the way through every time leaving a little doughiness in the middle. This particular night was different for some reason. First of all the Red Wings were on and this season they started a special where if the Wings are playing your can get a one topping pizza for $3.99. At that price you just can&rsquo;t afford not to. So I did and I have to say it was probably the best pizza I&rsquo;ve had at Harvey&rsquo;s. Have they figure this out? I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll find out soon enough as the NHL playoffs are soon going to be upon us and I&rsquo;ll probably using it as an excuse to get some of this pie. I wish Rachel could say the same for the chili lately.</p>

<p>As for the taste of the pizza, well, it&rsquo;s nothing special. But for four bucks and a decent taste it&rsquo;s getting two slices right out of the gate. Being that it was was and about the same the next morning I&rsquo;m bumping it up a slice. Maybe we&rsquo;ll do a round two next time.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
