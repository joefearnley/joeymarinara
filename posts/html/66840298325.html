                    <p>Another Friday night was upon us and dinner was the topic of conversations. I started looking through the coupon book to see if anything was appealing. Of course I dogeared a couple of pages containing pizza and was revisiting them. After little debate we decided on <a href="http://habsgoodeatsntreats.com/">Hab&rsquo;s</a>.</p>

<p>Hab&rsquo;s is a restaurant located on Lakeshore Dr. across the street from what is left of the paper mill. Growing up in the neighborhood, I remember when the place was The Mill Inn, which was a diner that the mill workers would go to for breakfast and lunch. At some point it turned into a Tony&rsquo;s then in the past year or two became Hab&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>They offer all kinds of items on their menu from pizza to sandwiches to gyros to ribs. This usually scares me in that it seems when restaurants do this and don&rsquo;t specialize in something, everything on the menu is a little mediocre. Regardless, I ended up ordering a buffalo chicken along with a pepperoni. I didn&rsquo;t ask if they deliver as I need to swing by the store to pick up some beers. After waiting for a few minutes I head to Lakeside.</p>

<p>The inside of Hab&rsquo;s is pretty small. There were only a couple places to sit in the inside and it didn&rsquo;t look like they got used very often. Behind the counter were a lot of people working. It was friday night and people were hungry. I paid for my pizza and headed back.</p>

<p>I opened the boxes when I got home and dug right in, starting with the pepperoni. This thing was loaded with pepperoni. It had a chewy crust that was just thick enough that I couldn&rsquo;t classify it as thin. The sauce wasn&rsquo;t too sweet or too bland. Over all it was a great combination.</p>

</p>

<p>Next I gave the buffalo chicken a try. We opted for no onions and no peppers that usually come on the pizza. I have to say it wasn&rsquo;t missed at all. This pizza was great. I didn&rsquo;t notice much of the sauce flavor but did like the drizzle along the top. I don&rsquo;t remember the chicken adding much to the pizza but it really didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

<p>For those of you that live in Muskegon and haven&rsquo;t tried the pizza at <a href="http://habsgoodeatsntreats.com/">Hab&rsquo;s</a>, I have to say you are totally missing out. I can&rsquo;t attest for the other things on the menu but if you are in the mood for pizza, I would suggest checking them out. Like I mentioned earlier, sometimes when restaurants stretch their menu out too far, it affects the food quality. That&rsquo;s certainly not the case here.</p>
