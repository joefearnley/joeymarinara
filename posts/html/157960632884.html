                    <p>I’m attempting a diet again this year. My weight has crept back over the last couple of years and I’m going to try to slim down before bathing suit season. The idea is to go hard on a diet for the next few months then eat whatever the hell I want. Part of the regiment is having a “cheat day” once a week where I eat whatever the hell I want. Last Saturday (in this case, my cheat day), after a family-related baby shower, Ray, her parents, and I made a pit stop at the <a href="http://%E2%80%9D" http:>Mona Lake Boat Club</a> on the way home for a night cap or three.</p>7

<p>The <a href="http://%E2%80%9D" http:>Mona Lake Boat Club</a> is a social club located on Mona Lake in Muskegon. For a yearly amount of money you can join the club to buy cheap drinks, cheap food, and utilize the boat launch. On this particular night, it was for the drinks but after a round or two, my father-in-law ordered a pizza so it was then for the food as well.</p>

<p>The in-laws love the deluxe pizza, so that is what he ordered. The crust was thin and crispy with not a much sauce going on above it. The cheese was nice and congealed, melted over move of the meat toppings. The pepperoni didn’t have much flavor either, reminding me a lot of a frozen Jack’s from the grocery store. For all I know it could have been a frozen Jack’s from the grocery store.</p>

<p>The Mona Lake Boat Club is an interesting place. I have a feeling in the 1970’s and 1980’s the place was much more popular. These days you won’t find many younger people hanging out. As for the pizza, it wasn’t too bad. If you ever feel the need to experience the Boat Club I’d suggest checking out the variety dinner on Friday nights or the parties at the Willow Point. Not only is the food better the people watching is the best.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
