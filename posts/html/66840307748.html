                    <p>This fall we took another trip to Colorado. This was going to be a short one, just a few days long. I was hoping to squeeze in a pizza joint at some point. Last time I managed to find <a href="http://joeymarinara.com/post/26940371242/dostal-alley-brewpub-casino">one place that I really liked</a><a></a>.We had a list of things to do while we were there that included a couple of brewery tours, Red Rocks, the zoo and of course the beer festival. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, we managed to score some tickets to the Great American Beer Festival which is basically why we went this time of year. We had a lot planned in the few days we were. The day of the festival we were able to get in on the distillery tour offered by Stranahan&rsquo;s. They offer free tours of their operation which was only a couple of minutes from where we were staying. After learning how whiskey is made (and drank) we headed to <a href="http://www.fatsullys.com/">Fat Sully&rsquo;s</a> for lunch. </p>

<p>From what I understand there are a few of these places around town. We went to the one on Colfax that is actually inside a brewpub called <a href="http://www.atomiccowboy.net/">Atomic Cowboy</a>. There is also a place inside there Denver Biscuit Co. (which we didn&rsquo;t check out). We got seated, ordered some drinks and checked out the menu. </p>

<p>There were basically three different options for pies - 12&quot;, 20&quot; and 26&quot;. They also offered pizza by the slice.  No slices were available at the moment, so we narrowed it down to a full pizza. After going back and forth on the size, we saw a waitress carrying out a 26&quot; pie and were immediately sold. We ordered one with pepperoni and green pepper. The waitress said it was take a little longer than normal because of the size and were fine with that. </p>

<p>About 25 minutes later the pie came out. I&rsquo;m not sure if these photos really do it justice but the slices were huge. The only place I&rsquo;ve had that was comparable was <a href="http://">Georgios</a> or <a href="http://">Bonanno&rsquo;s</a>. This was definitely going to be a two-hand job. I was in for a treat.</p>

</p>

<p>I took my first bite and let the flavors set in. I managed to get some green pepper in there right out of the gate so it threw things off a bit. I&rsquo;m not a fan of green pepper on my pie but there were four of us splitting this one and I had to compromise. One thing I noticed about the peppers were that they were were slices and in clumps as opposed to diced like I normally see. It didn&rsquo;t seem to have any affect on the flavor though. </p>

<p>The cheese and sauce were the perfect mixed. The crust was thin and not too crispy. The slices so big in the end I could take down one and a half of another. After that I was filled to the brim. It was a good preparation for the beer festival. And of course there were left overs that would be devoured later that night.</p>

<p>It turns out this place was <a href="http://www.fatsullys.com/wp-content/themes/fat-sullys/ddd-overlay.html">featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives</a> which I am sure got it a lot of attention as it should. The place also offers board games to play while to hang out there. I would definitely go back to Atomic Cowboy. After was that video the gourmet biscuits like awesome. While there, you can always grab a slice.</p>
