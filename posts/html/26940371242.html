                                    <h1>Dostal Alley Brewpub & Casino</h1>
                    <p>So my summer vacation officially started. It was smooth sailing out to Colorado. The first couple of days there we did the typical touristy stuff that included a tour of the Coors brewery in Golden, a local street fair filled with beer, dogs and bicycles and a swing through Red Rocks. On this day though our plan was to head further into the mountains. Ron wanted to visit the small town of Blackhawk which apparently consists of a bunch of casinos, bars and shops. On our way there we stopped at another little town near Blackhawk called Central City. Unfortunately there isn&rsquo;t a whole lot going on on a Monday morning in a town like this so after hitting up a few slot machines we decided to grab some lunch. There weren&rsquo;t too many options let alone it being a Monday morning but I saw a sign for a place called <a href="http://www.dostalalley.net/Site/Home.html">Dostal Alley</a> that served pizza and brewed its own beer. I was sold and convinced the others so in we went.</p>

<p>After walking in we headed down stairs to grab a seat and order food. A waitress walked out and we ordered a couple of pizzas and some drinks. I personally got the IPA they offered and the waitress went to the kitchen to cooked things up. We had some beers, played a couple of slot machines and before we knew it out came the food. </p>

<p>The pizzas were fairly small, somewhere around 14 inches. The crust was somewhat thick and very doughy. Cheese was melted on nice and was topped with pepperoni. The whole taste was not bad at all. Again the crust was pretty soft so you almost had to eat it with a fork or use two hands. Another option was to just roll up the slice starting with the crust to make a mini stromboli like concoction. Very tasty.</p>

<p>All in all I&rsquo;d say Dostal Alley was a success. After lunch we ordered a sampler of the different beers they offered in the upstairs bar and bought a copy of the local paper. It was neat to see a different part of the Denver area and will certainly have to make a stop back here the next time I&rsquo;m around.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
