                                    <h1>Vitale's on 54th</h1>
                    <p>It’s a bit strange that I don’t know that many people I work with. Granted, the company is huge and I’ve only been there what I think is a short amount of time. A meeting I had last year led to a coworker asking me to grab lunch with him to talk about a possible music venture. I agreed and we kind of went back and forth about where we wanted to go. At one point he suggested <a href="#%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.theoriginalvitales.com/%E2%80%9D">Vitales on 54th St</a>. It has been on my list of pizza joints to check out in the area. We ultimately agreed on it.</p>

<p>I’ve been to another Vitale’s a couple of years ago and <a href="#%E2%80%9Dhttp://joeymarinara.com/post/8803250240/vitales%E2%80%9D">wrote about the plesant experience I had there</a>.  They have a few locations around Grand Rapids. The on on 54th St. was much smaller. It kind of seemed like more a take out joint but did offer a buffet. I think it was around $7 for all-you-can-eat pizza and a drink. I orderd that and headed over to the buffet.</p>

<p>Again, this place was pretty small inside and the buffet only consisted of a couple of pizzas and some bread sticks. The options were limited but still looked good. The first time up I grabbed a slice of the ham and bacon they were offering. It looks as if it was straight out of the over. And tasted like it too. My initial thoughts were is wasn’t as good as the <a href="#%E2%80%9Dhttp://joeymarinara.com/post/8803250240/vitales%E2%80%9D">Spicy Lovers</a> I had before but wasn’t bad at all. </p>

<p>It was a little thicker than your average thin crust. The sauce was a bit on the sweet side and covered in toppings. You really can’t go wrong with ham and bacon as it added some great savoriness to it. My second time up I grabbed a slice of the pepperoni, a slice of the stuffed pizza and a couple of breadsticks. The pepperoni was pretty mediocre. It was hard to compare it to the ham and bacon but was good none-the-less. The stuffed pizza was fantastic. It was only pepperoni but tasted great. The breadsticks were great as well. Nice and buttery. That mixed with side of marinara made the meal complete.</p>

<p>Between <a href="http://joeymarinara.com/post/66578359528/uccellos">my trip to Uccello’s</a> and this buffet, I’m beginning to wonder why I don’t order a stuffed pizza more often. I don’t seem to ever recall seeing it on the menu. Regardless, I would certainly suggest checking out and of the Vitale’s locations if you haven’t already. They make a great pizza. If you are ever around the southern area of Grand Rapids and are looking for a great quick lunch, I’d suggest checking on the the location on 54th St. It’s definitely worth the $7.</p>
