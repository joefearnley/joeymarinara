                    <p>You only turn 28 once and my parents wanted to take me out to eat for my birthday. It was my choice and I am on this pizza kick so I opted for <a title="http://www.rcfc.com/backdoorpizzeria/" href="http://www.rcfc.com/backdoorpizzeria/">Pietro&rsquo;s</a> in Grand Rapids. I haven&rsquo;t been to this place since travel hockey in the mid 90&rsquo;s and not a whole lot has changed. The <a title="http://www.rcfc.com/Pietros/" href="http://www.rcfc.com/Pietros/">front portion</a> of the restaurant is what seems to be a somewhat fancy Italian joint. The back portion is a pizza joint with a sports bar vibe. I remember this place being really good back in the day so I figured I&rsquo;d give it a shot.</p>

<p>We opted for the deep dish. In my head I was planning on chicago style for some reason so I was thrown for a loop when it finally came out. There was an actual chicago style on the menu (which some how I missed) and an award-winning stuffed pie that looked really good. Next time I will have to give one of those a go.Â </p>

<p>The deep dish was of course excellent. My only complaint being the crust as it was a little overwhelming at times. It was thick though, so much I could only take down two slices. It was warm and the sauce was great (a bit on the sweet side). Again I would really like to try some of the other options Pietro&rsquo;s has to offer.</p>
<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
