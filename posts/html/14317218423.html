                    <p>So these last couple of weekends have been quite uneventful for me. It&rsquo;s that time of year where my weekends are spent making sure grass somewhat grows back next year. That means raking up all the leaves in my yard and putting them into bags so some dude can come pick them up one day in December. I don&rsquo;t know about you but the whole thing sounds like I am losing out on the home ownership thing. Regardless, this whole raking and bagging thing really works up an appetite and the only thing on my mind come dinner time was pizza.</p>

<p>I had a few errands to run and decided to order a pie from Pizza King. I wasn&rsquo;t too concerned about the options that I had, I really only wanted pepperoni and cheese. I actually picked up a menu for them some time last year (at the liquor store next to the place) and don&rsquo;t remember them having too many options to choose from. Basically they offer 12, 14, and 16 inches with your typical meat and vegetable options. With no sides, I ordered up a 14-incher for pickup and had twenty minutes until it was ready.</p>

<p>The place is located across the street from the Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport on the corner of a little plaza. It reminded me a lot of <a href="http://joeymarinara.com/post/587232886/chicago-style-pizza">Chicago Style Pizza</a> in that it&rsquo;s merely a counter that you order and pick up from with a man making pies while a woman handled my order. </p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind about Pizza King is that they do not offer style variations only a single thin crust. I wasn&rsquo;t aware of this so looking back I probably would have ordered a 16 inch. Rachel and I blazed though the 14-incher with no problem. My only complaint was that buy the time I got the pizza home, it didn&rsquo;t taste as fresh as I imagined it straight out of the oven. I also don&rsquo;t usually prefer thin crust so I was a little let down after getting it home and opening the box. But after biting in I was pleasantly surprised. The greasy, cheesy taste was more than welcome. Combing that with a cold beer I have to say my dinner turned out pretty awesome.</p>

<p>All in all Pizza King turned out to be a good choice. It&rsquo;s apparently some sort of a staple in Kalamazoo that&rsquo;s been around for many years. The formula they have is a simple one that obviously works so I don&rsquo;t see this place going away any time soon. If you like thin-crust pizza at a decent price I&rsquo;d suggest checking out Pizza King. It won&rsquo;t let you down.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
