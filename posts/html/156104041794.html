                                    <h1>Mitten Brewing Company</h1>
                    <p>Yet another brewery has popped up in Grand Rapids. This time with a named related to Michigan. <a href="http://www.mittenbrewing.com/">The Mitten</a> actually opened up a while ago and for most of that time, whenever someone referred to it, I thought they were talking about the place in Ludington. A couple of friends wanted to get together after work on a Friday for a couple of beers and one of them suggested this place. Beer? Pizza? I was in.</p>

<p>The Mitten is located on the west side of Grand Rapids, not far from downtown on Leonard St. which is right on my way home. The building is an old firehouse that got converted into a commercial property decades ago. Parking is damn near impossible for this place especially at 5pm on a Friday in the middle of winter. I eventually found a spot which was basically in a snow bank in someone’s front yard. </p>

<p>The place had a pretty cool vibe to it. Brick walls, cement floors, and high ceiling led to it being loud this time of the day. We found a spot next to a wall, posted up, and ordered some beers. I opted for the IPA currently on tap.</p>

<p>We checked out the menu and talked about what we should order. The menu basically has appetizers and pizza. There are several specialty pizzas you can choose from or you can just make your own. They also offered a kids menu as well as a few dessert options.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of debate, we decided to go with the Pizza Flight. For $25, you can order 6 mini versions of any of the specialty pizzas they offer. For the pizzas, we went with Pepperoni, Da Meat Hook, The Heater, Pesto Chicken, Hawaian, and Chipotle Barbeque. It was a toss up between the Chipotle Barbeque and Thai Cobb. I don’t remember what exactly was the deciding factor on that one, but in the end we went with Barbeque. </p>

<p>About 20 minutes later, the pizza came out. They were served on a large cutting board. The pizza are of the flatbread style. Or at least these small ones were. I started with the pepperoni to even the playing field. Nothing really stood out to me as far as the flavor was concerned. Just a great combination of cheese, sauce, and crust. The pepperonis themselves were cooked enough to have a little crunch to them, which I liked. The crust was that of a light, flowery, crispy, crunchy type. The combination of the crust and some marinara was about all I needed when I was done.</p>

<p>Next up was the meat lovers. It was pretty much the same as the pepperoni but with the addition of a few more meats. As far as I’m concerned, you can’t really go wrong with that. I don’t really do fruit on my pizza so I didn’t even try the Hawaiian. I tried the Chipotle Barbeque next and then the Chicken Pesto. They we still good but nothing to write home about. Finally, I tried The Heater. This one surprised me the most. I’m not a fan of green peppers, but that combination of habanero sauce, banana peppers, and sausage was like a match made in heaven. Throw some jalapenos on there for some heated kick and you got yourself a great pizza. </p>

<p>If you haven’t been to The Mitten yet, you are missing out on some great atmosphere, pizza, and beer. I’m not a beer snob by any means, but the IPA I had was great. They seem to have a constant rotating tap list which holds all kinds of beers. As for the pizza, if I had to do it over again, I’d go with The Heater with no green peppers. So give it a go if you are in Grand Rapids looking for a great meal with some great beer. You won’t be disappointed. </p>
