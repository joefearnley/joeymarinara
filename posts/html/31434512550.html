                                    <h1>Pizza Villa #1</h1>
                    <p>It&rsquo;s another week of summer and another day I am out to lunch (literally and sometimes figuratively). The thing is, my office is moving. Not far but I feel like I need to squeeze in some more pizza joints before the big move and before I take a little vacation (more on that later). </p>

<p>I remember seeing this place right by The Beltline Bar called <a href="http://www.villapizza1.com/">Pizza Villa</a>. On this particular day I actually attempted to go to Carlo&rsquo;s but the line was basically out the door and I didn&rsquo;t feel like waiting so I risked it and headed down to Pizza Villa #1 in hopes that they have slices for sale. Turns out according to the sign outside, they do have slices for sale. So pulled in and headed inside.</p>

<p>Let me stop right here for moment and point out a couple of things about this place that strike me as kind of odd. First of all, they place is called <a href="http://www.villapizza1.com/">Pizza Villa #1</a>. Why the number? I didn&rsquo;t ask when I went in but from a little research later it turns out there are two Pizza Villa locations around town. Hell, there may be three or four for I know but this one was #1. Secondly, on the awning of the place, they list other dishes they serve including something called the happy dog, salads, subs, etc&hellip; Now for me this is always kind of a turn off. If you have pizza in the name of your restaurant, I would never imagine ordering a hot dog or burrito from you (in this case they didn&rsquo;t offer burritos, but some of these pizza joints do). It&rsquo;s like going to The Station and ordering nachos. I mean, who does that?</p>

<p>After a little more investigation the only thing that was really weird was this thing called a happy dog. In my head, I&rsquo;m picturing an American-style hot dog with ketchup and mustard. Turns out they serve this thing that&rsquo;s basically Stromboli with a hot dog and bacon in it. It was little an Italian twist on it. It certainly changed the way I looked at it. Unfortunately, that wasn&rsquo;t the case walking in.</p>

<p>Inside the place was a typical pizza joint. A couple of tables, a counter to order from and a couple of arcade games. They we offering slices of pepperoni for sale for a buck a pop. Again, I have no idea what they look like ordered three and a Diet Coke to go. About 5 minutes later my food came out and I headed to the closest McDonalds to steal some wifi and eat my lunch.</p>

<p>Once I got the box open I soon realized this wasn&rsquo;t going to turn out the way I had hoped. I could tell the slices were basically reheated. Through the oven or however they did it. The cheese was way too melted and crust was way overdone. The cheese tasted similar to something from a cheap pie at a bowling alley, not a place with pizza in it&rsquo;s name. I was hungry so I took down all three slices but needless to say I was pretty disappointed. </p>

<p>I probably will not be going back to the Villa #1 for pizza again. I might try the other location being that it will be a little closer to my new office. The happy dog has me intrigued though and I really want to give it a try sometime. If you are ever in the area and hungry I&rsquo;d suggest just going to The Beltline Bar instead. Even though I think that place is overrated but that&rsquo;s another entry in itself. </p>

<p>Final Rating: 2 Slices</p>
