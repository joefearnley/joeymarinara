                    <p>As <a href="http://joeymarinara.com/post/179217132129/basil-leaf-pizza">previously</a> <a href="http://joeymarinara.com/post/179217226129/eat-n-out">mentioned,</a> I attended a conference over the last weekend that was full of tech and pizza. On the second day lunch was catered but I wanted slip in one more pizza place. I mentioned it before but when I first did a run through the casino when I got there on Thursday night, I saw a place selling pizza and sandwiches. I wanted a bit of a break from conference rooms for a while so I headed out to the casino when lunch time came.</p>

<p>The place was called <a href="https://www.greektowncasino.com/restaurants/stackd-restaurant/">Stack’d</a> and was located in the Greektown casino. They offer pizza, sandwiches, salads, and a handful of appetizers. There were a few different pizzas in the hopper. After a short debate in my brain on whether to get the meat lovers or just pepperoni I decided on the pepperoni to keep things consistent. I grabbed a beer at the bar and sat down to eat.</p>

<p>The pizza has a nice thick crust on it. The cheese was plentiful tasted pretty fresh with the pepperoni complementing it nicely. Honestly there was nothing special to this pizza, seemed a bit on the cheap end of the pizza spectrum. At the time, though, the slice combined with the cold beer was exactly what I was looking for.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t tell anyone <a href="https://www.greektowncasino.com/restaurants/stackd-restaurant/">Stack’d</a> is the first stop for food you should make in Greektown by any means. I feel like it’s more of a last resort or even a snack option. That or if you want to tank a cigarette while you eat dinner this would probably be the place for you. Smoked-filled ambiance aside,  I have to hand it to the place, they makes a pretty good pie.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
