                    <p>Summer is finally starting show its face around these parts. The spring and summer seasons means that bands go on tours which means The Menzingers are going on tour. Luckily this year brought them to Grand Rapids and I made plans with a bunch of friends to go, specifically with my pal A.C. to grab some dinner and drinks before the show.</p>

<p>A.C. lives on the West side of Grand Rapids and frequents the watering holes in the area. On this evening I arrived in town at his place a few hours before the show. We threw around ideas of where we wanted to go eat. The show was downtown so we first thought about going somewhere there. A.C. threw out the idea trying this place called <a href="http://bluedogtaverngr.com/">Blue Dog</a> not far from his house. I agreed and we headed out.</p>

<p><a href="http://bluedogtaverngr.com/">Blue Dog Tavern</a> is located on the West side of Grand Rapids on Stocking not far from the highway. The building <a href="http://bluedogtaverngr.com/history.html">has quite the history behind it</a> including originally being a grocery store then bank at one time, finally becoming a bar. They are currently known for their gourmet hot dogs as (called blue dogs) as well as their burgers and sandwiches.</p>

<p>We bellied up to the bar, ordered a couple of beers and reviewed the menu. A burgers or sandwich sounded like a bit too much for me. I opted for a “Healthy Choice” and went with the buffalo chicken flatbread pizza. We put in our order and about 15 minutes later our food came out.</p>

<p>The pizza was a round, 9 inch flatbread pie with buffalo sauce, an assortment of cheeses, and chunks of white chicken with a side of ranch. The crust was very crispy on the outside but nice and chewy on the inside. I’m a sucker for the popular combination of melted cheese and buffalo sauce (buffalo anything, really) which was warm, tasty, and not too spicy. The chicken didn’t add much flavor to the pie but was enough protein to keep me full throughout the night.</p>

<p><a href="http://bluedogtaverngr.com/">Blue Dog Tavern</a> is a really cool spot. It has the old school bar feel but serves great modern food. Much better than your typical pub grub. If you ever find yourself on the West side of Grand Rapids looking for a bit to eat Blue Dog is a strong choice. I’m sure I will be going back there again sometime soon. Oh, and the show was great as always.</p>
