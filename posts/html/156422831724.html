                                    <h1>The Third Street Grill</h1>
                    <p>Since starting my new job I’ve been eying a few places to eat. Most days I either bring my own lunch or am in a hurry so I hit up one of the fast food joints in the area. Last week a group of co-workers suggested hitting up the restaurant in the lobby of the Holiday Inn called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThirdStreetGrille/" target="_blank">Third Street Grille</a>. They have a lunch buffet during the week and someone got a hold of a coupon online that was buy one, get one free, so we decided to hit it up.</p>

<p>The Third Street Grille is located in the Holiday Inn in downtown Muskegon. I’m not sure how long it has been there, but it&rsquo;s been several years now. When I was a kid my family would stay at the hotel (it was a Hilton back then) during the Lumbertown festival and I don’t recall a restaurant being there but there was always some sort of bar or lounge.</p>

<p>I didn’t look at the menu, so I am not sure what they offer outside of the buffet, but from what I could tell it they had a little bit of everything. The buffet offered pizza, salad, pasta sandwiches, and a couple of deserts. I opted for a bit of the pizza, a hunk of sandwich, and a little pasta.</p>

<p>The pizza was that of a flatbread style. At the time they only had two options. One was what I would call a Southwest mix. It had tomatoes, bacon, corn, black beans, and some sort of white sauce. You couldn’t really taste the white sauce and the corn and black beans were a little overbearing. I suppose the bacon could have saved it but I think there was one piece on each piece of pizza that I got.</p>

<p>The other option had broccoli, bacon, and, from what I could tell, the same white sauce. Like with the other, I could not white sauce. I am all about broccoli in certain dishes but for me pizza is not one of them. Unfortunately I had the experience with lacking bacon which I think could have also saved this pie.</p>

<p>Buffets are tricky and if not done right can leave a lot to be desired. That is certainly what happened in my case. I would only suggest it if you are not paying, even with a half-off coupon.  Being in the location it is, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThirdStreetGrille/" target="_blank">Third Street Grille</a> has a lot of potential. There are not a ton of places to eat in downtown Muskegon and this place is kind of a pillar. I would definitely give the place another try but I am defnitely going to order something off the menu.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 2 slices</p>
