                                    <h1>Old Peninsula Brew Pub</h1>
                    <p>With the summer winding down but the weather still fantastic and neither Rachel or I looking to cook, we started discussing where we wanted to dine on this particular Tuesday night. I started thinking about the places we haven&rsquo;t been in a while. I started thinking about the downtown options and eventually came to the conclusion that I haven&rsquo;t been to <a href="http://oldepenkazoo.com/">Olde Peninsula</a> in a quite some time. There were a couple of other options thrown in but my mind was made up, O.P. it was.</p>

<p>For those of you who are unaware, Olde Peninsula is located in the heart of downtown Kalamazoo. They have been around forever, brew their own beer, and offer a somewhat unique menu, officially dubbed a &ldquo;Brewpub and Restaurant&rdquo;. I have to be honest, I&rsquo;ve eaten here many times (even have one of their growlers sitting in my basement I think) but have never been a fan of their food. They do offer your run of the mill bar food so there is always some to fall back on but unfortunately the dishes I feel they want to be known for don&rsquo;t really do it for me.</p>

<p>Regardless of what I like on the menu there is always pizza. Something I didn&rsquo;t realize O.P. even offered. I guess it&rsquo;s not something I think of when in a place like this. Regardless, I checked them out. The 9 inch offers included vegetarian, chicken alfredo, barbecue, and assorted cheese. The barbecue chicken, even though a little much for pizza, looked like the best option as far as I was concerned. I ordered one up along with an OP IPA and the waiter went on his way.</p>

<p>One the pizza arrived, I was reassured that it was indeed a little much. It came loaded with bacon, chicken, a couple of different cheeses and barbecue sauce. The sauce was very noticeable, probably more than anything on the pie. It had a sweet taste and it appears is made with beer (thus the name Beer-B-Que). The cheese was a little over done. If there is one thing I like on my pie it&rsquo;s good melted cheese. This combination of cheddar and monterey jack just didn&rsquo;t do it for me. The crust was alright, a little doughy for me. Then of course there was bacon. You can never go wrong with bacon.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I would ever order the pizza again at O.P. If I would I would try one of the different offerings. You can&rsquo;t go wrong with the beer though. If you are ever making your rounds in downtown Kalamazoo be sure to stop in to O.P. for a pint. Then don&rsquo;t be afraid to head to Winston&rsquo;s next door for desert.</p>
