                    <p>I’ve settled in nicely to my new job working in Grand Haven and started checking out pizza joints around the area. There are a couple places downtown to grab a decent pie, as well as the east side of town, and a few scattered around other parts of town.</p>

<p>One of which is a party store (that is actually in Ferrysburg) just off of US 31 when you leave town that I’ve stopped at a few times. Inside there is a party store, a pizza and sub shop named <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Appolonias-Pizza-Surfside-Liquor/416511085159387">Appolonia&rsquo;s</a>, and a tanning salon. After talking with the women behind the counter while checking out, she mentioned they have pizza slices during lunch hours. I’ve been planning on picking up some takeout from this place for a while but never coordinated it, and after learning of its lunch offering, I decided to head there last week.</p>

<p>The day I went to check it out they only had one pizza on the rack they were offering slices for. The toppings were sausage and mushroom. Obviously it wasn’t my first choice but didn’t want to wait around for something else so I grabbed two slices and headed out. Appolonia&rsquo;s is pretty much take out only and doesn’t have any seating so I decided to pull in the back parking lot and eat.</p>

<p>The slices were a pretty good size. The crust was a little flaky yet a bit on the soft size. The sauce was very tomatoey and salty. The mushroom tasted like it was canned (which I’m not much of a fan of mushrooms anyway) and the sausage added some spice to things. The only thing I think this pizza was lacking was the cheese. They had plenty of room to add some more and totally slacked on that part.</p>

<p>Being that that only had a mushroom sausage combination to offer was kind of a bummer. I really would have liked to try the pepperoni. Also, the pictures I saw of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Appolonias-Pizza-Surfside-Liquor/416511085159387">Appolonia&rsquo;s</a> pizza all looked to have a much thinner crust than the slices I tried. Maybe it was a different crust? Regardless it was very good and I am hoping to try it again, next time with pepperoni.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
