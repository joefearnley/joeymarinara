                    <p>Alright, now we get to the good parts. When I mentioned that some things are almost mythical the other side of that is how known something is. Known in a good way. This past weekend we choose to eat at <a href="http://www.erbellis.com/">Erbelli&rsquo;s Gourmet Pizzeria, Italian Bistro &amp; Pub</a>. I know it&rsquo;s a mouthful but so is the pizza and want to keep stuffing more in.</p>

<p>This wasn&rsquo;t my first time here. I&rsquo;d been to the one out in Portage several years ago and the newer one off of Stadium Drive. I&rsquo;ve only been there on the weekend and it&rsquo;s always packed at dinner time. One of the first things you notice about Erbelli&rsquo;s menu is how many different choices you have for pizza. It&rsquo;s a little over whelming actually. I was in the mood for some Chicago style so the waitress said the closest thing at the time would be the stuffed pizza.</p>

<p>This style is basically two crusts stuff with cheese and covered with signature sauce. It was so thick I had to use a fork to eat it. The sauce was on the sweet side and the mozzarella from the inside was oozing all over my plate. Two slices in I certainly wanted more but my stomach was saying no. I had to fold but it wasn&rsquo;t because of the taste.</p>

<p>I would really like to try some of the other pizza options on Erbelli&rsquo;s menu. These things take time. One day I am going to be able to hit up the lunch buffet to be able to try multiple selections at once. As for now I can only hope they will be as good as what I&rsquo;ve had so far.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 5 slices</p>
