                    <p>Well the holiday season has officially started. I suppose it started about a month ago depending on who you ask, but this is Christmas, a time to spend with family and friends. This particular Friday night I was planning on meeting up with some friends at a local establishment in Muskegon. Minutes after arriving Shann came through the door with a few pies from <a href="http://www.glensidepub.net/">Glenside Pub</a> and offered some up. I thanked her and grabbed a plate.</p>
<p>The house I grew up in was only a few minutes from Glenside Pub. Although back then it was named Some Place Else but the pizza was the same. We ordered from here on a regular basis. It was either that or Dominoes that was a few blocks down the street. I used to go up there with my dad. He&rsquo;d order a beer and a pizza and I would order a Coke. Ah memories.</p>
<p>The only option on this night was some sort of deluxe version with multiple meats. I usually don&rsquo;t opt for deluxe but I was pretty hungry and it smelled damn good. Glenside Pub&rsquo;s pizza reminds me a lot of Martini&rsquo;s in that the sauce is exceptional. It&rsquo;s really what makes the pizza. Combine the sweet sauce with more than enough cheese and you got yourself a great pie. And of course, party cut.</p>

<p>The weird part about this was I actually ate Glenside Pub pizza a week before while at my parents but never got a picture of it. I haven&rsquo;t had the stuff in years and now had it two weeks in a row. If you ever find yourself in Muskegon with a hunkering for pizza I&rsquo;d suggest checking out Glenside Pub.</p>
<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
