                                    <h1>Saddle Up Frozen Pie</h1>
                    <p>When we finally got off the mountain and headed back to Camp Cox, which is located conveniently down the road from the great <a href="https://www.facebook.com/saddleupgasandgrocery/">Saddle Up</a>, we made quick stop for some hoagies, more beer, and one of these frozen pizzas Adam keeps talking about. We thought maybe about getting some whiskey but didn’t. What a good idea that was.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/saddleupgasandgrocery/">Saddle Up</a> is an interesting place. Each time we go up to Bear Lake we make multiple stops there. It looks like an old farm house with a porch that wraps around it. It’s basically a small grocery store and the only thing close to it that as far as that is concerned is at least as half hour away.</p>

<p>I don’t remember what the brand of the pizza was, but it was certainly your typical frozen pizza. A bit on the thick side with super soft crust on the inside and crispy on the bottom. It must be the way you make them. The pepperoni was the thick style that you usually find on these types of pizza and the cheese was, well, cheese. After a couple of slices and a couple of beers I’d had my fill.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/saddleupgasandgrocery/">Saddle Up</a> frozen pizza wasn’t the best I’ve had and certainly wasn’t the worst. In a pinch, these pies can be a great dinner, especially with the options in Bear Lake. I’m sure it won’t be the last time I eat one. If you ever find yourself taking that drive up US 31 to Traverse City or beyond, do yourself a favor a make a pit stop at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/saddleupgasandgrocery">Saddle Up</a>. Chances are you get to see some local talent.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
