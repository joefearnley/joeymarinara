                                    <h1>Jaspare's Pizza</h1>
                    <p>It&rsquo;s Friday night, band practice on the schedule, what better way to feed yourself and friends by ordering up some pies? This particular night we decided to go with <a href="http://www.jasparespizza.com/">Jaspare&rsquo;s</a>. This place, similar to <a href="http://joeymarinara.com/post/587232886/chicago-style-pizza">Chicago Style</a>, had quite the reputation around these parts (and god damn it if that didn&rsquo;t hold completely strong in my eyes). There are a few locations around the area although after driving by the Portage location the other day on my way to hockey it didn&rsquo;t look like that particular spot had seen any action in a while. </p>
<p>This pizza had it all. Solid on the crust, solid on the cheese and that sauce made me want to lick every dropping on the box. I wasn&rsquo;t there to order so I don&rsquo;t know what the options were but we ended up with a medium-sized crust (typical size I just don&rsquo;t know how else to put it). It lived up to the hype across the board. After stuffing our faces and finishing up band practice, we headed out for a few drinks and to tell more people about the bomb-ass pizza I had earlier. Unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t get any pictures of the pizza this time around. Next time gadget, next time.</p>
<p>Finally I round out the night over at my next-door neighbors house who is having a party. One of the last dudes there was a guys wearing a Jaspare&rsquo;s Pizza sweatshirt. I think it still had some flour on it from that nights shift. I told him how awesome the pizza was and that I was starting this blog to rate pizza and&hellip;well I was drunk and probably sounded like an idiot. He kindly smiled like he cared and agreed that the pizza was good. I&rsquo;ll take what I can get.</p>
<p>Final rating: 5 slices</p>
