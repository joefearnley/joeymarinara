                                    <h1>Deluca's</h1>
                    <p> Last week a few pals and I ventured out of town to see The Menzingers. They are a band from Philadelphia rolling into Lansing to play a show. What better way to spend a Tuesday night than driving an hour and a half in the middle of winter to see a punk rock show? I met up with my pals in Grand Rapids and we set off for the state capital in Justin&rsquo;s fancy Cadillac.</p>

<p>We needed to grab dinner and after conversing via text messages during the day about it, we decided to grab pizza at what we came to the conclusion is the best pizza in the Lansing area, <a href="http://delucaspizza.com/">Deluca&rsquo;s</a>. Located in an area of town I&rsquo;ve never been before, Deluca&rsquo;s is located in an older looking building with a great sign to match. </p>

<p>The decor inside looks like it has not been updated in quite some time, but gave it a lot of character. The hostess sat up in the back corner and handed us some menus. After little deliberation, we ordered a large pepperoni pie and some beers. </p>

<p>After a bit of conversation and building excitement, the pizza arrived at our table. It was very fresh. It had a good amount of cheese on it and the sauce was fresh as could be. I felt like the crust was a bit on the thick side for this type pie, adding a lot of extra space with no taste. I ended up eating several slices before I threw in the towel.</p>

<p><a href="http://delucaspizza.com/">Deluca&rsquo;s</a> has quite the reputation in the Lansing area as well as around the state. For as much hype as there was around the place I was a little disappointed. It was not bad by any means, it just, to me, anything special. That also doesn’t mean stay away from the place. The place is a staple and a ton of people like it, for some it’s their favorite. If you are ever in the area definitely checking it out sometime.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
