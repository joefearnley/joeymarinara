                                    <h1>Sluggo’s</h1>
                    <p>I forgot my lunch on Monday and was certainly not up for the task of trying to find something healthy to eat. I saw a picture of a piece of pizza somewhere and it got me thinking…and, well, it sounded really good. I pulled out my trusty list of pizza places to try near my office and started researching. At first <a href="https://www.orderstart.com/peppinosholland" target="_blank">Peppino’s</a> sounded like the way to go and they offered some sort of lunch special. Being that I just ate there <a href="http://joeymarinara.com/post/165063780569/peppinos-pizzeria-sports-grille" target="_blank"> about a week ago</a>, I ended up settling on <a href="http://www.sluggospizzeria.com" target="_blank">Sluggo’s</a>.</p>

<p>When I arrived, I asked the girl behind the counter if they sold slices and she said no. She didn’t suggest any sort of lunch special so but I looked up and they had a two topping, 10 inch pizza for $6.50. I decided to go with that with pepperoni and bacon as the toppings. Waiting for my pizza to cook I checked out the rest of the menu. They have a ton of specialty pizzas as well as subs and salads that all seemed to be decently priced.</p>

<p>About 10 minutes later my pizza came out. Looking at it I knew right away I wouldn’t be able to conquer this whole thing in one sitting, but I wasted no time and dug in. This was a bit of a mistake as the pizza had just come out of the oven. Similarly to <a href="http://joeymarinara.com/post/163792658934/strombolis" target="_blank">Stromboli’s</a> they put the toppings down first and the cheese on top. This tends to trap the heat inside, leading to me burning my mouth.</p>

<p>On the first slice I noticed the crunchiness of the crust. The slice was full of bacon and pepperoni and the sauce was piping hot causing the cheese to have a nice stretch to it as I pulled it apart. After struggling through the first slice I took a little break to let the pizza cool. After biting into the second slice I noticed the crunchiness of the crust had gone way down. The greasiness of the meats and cheese caused it to soften up a bit but it still tasted really good - cheesier and greasier. I got three quarters through the pie before I threw in the towel.</p>

<p>Ultimately I was a little annoyed after looking at the menu. They offer a 7 inch version of all of their regular and specialty pies. That would have been a much better choice for me being that I didn’t want to go back to work in the hurt box, but I had a couple of slices for later. <a href="http://www.sluggospizzeria.com" target="_blank">Sluggo’s</a> was a good choice. I wouldn’t go rushing there tonight for dinner but if you are on the West side of Holland some time looking for a bit, check out <a href="http://www.sluggospizzeria.com/" target="_blank">Sluggo’s</a>.  They have plenty to offer that is decently priced and seem to serve it in a timely manner.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
