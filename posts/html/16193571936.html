                                    <h1>Handsome Henry's Deep Dish</h1>
                    <p>This weekend it was back to Muskegon once again. It has only been a couple of weeks since we were home for the holidays then the new year. Rock and roll was actually the reason I was back here so that was cool. Rachel and I rolled into town a little late on Friday night and hadn&rsquo;t eaten dinner yet so we were looking for a place to grab some food. We first checked to see if anyone else was interested but at this point it was almost nine o'clock and there were no takers.</p>
<p>Over the course of last year whenever I was in Muskegon I would see <a href="http://www.handsomehenrysrestaurant.com/sg_home_content/pictures/picturebox/4-1.jpg" title="http://www.handsomehenrysrestaurant.com/sg_home_content/pictures/picturebox/4-1.jpg">this billboard for Chicago-style pizza</a> at <a href="http://www.handsomehenrysrestaurant.com/" title="Handsome Henry's">Handsome Henry&rsquo;s</a>. It had a picture of the pie right on the billboard and looked delicious. Since I didn&rsquo;t hit the pizza joints like I wanted to over the holidays my vote was Handsome Henry&rsquo;s and Rachel obliged.</p>
<p>For those of you who are unaware, Handsome Henry&rsquo;s is located in what used to be a Finley&rsquo;s in the heart of Henry St.&rsquo;s Roosevelt Park business area. <a href="http://joeymarinara.com/post/774577279/handsome-henrys" title="http://joeymarinara.com/post/774577279/handsome-henrys">I&rsquo;ve actually reviewed this place before</a> and thought highly of their thin-crust pies. But this time I was in for the deep dish. We put in our order for one along with an IPA of some sort. You&rsquo;re allowed up to four toppings with the pie and all we wanted to pepperoni. The waitress suggested we double up on the pepperoni and cheese. We agreed and went for it.</p>

<p>Once it came out I was surprised at how small it was. They make it seem big in the billboard and on the menu but I never checked to see what size it actually was. Ten inches apparently. But when you have cheese mixed in with four toppings and double the cheese in our case, the diameter really doesn&rsquo;t matter. I dug in by grabbing the largest slice I could find. The more cheese the merrier as far as I&rsquo;m concerned when it comes to Chicago-style so I was happy. The one thing that stuck out to me with the pizza was the sauce. It was a sort of sweet and kind of tangy mixture that I thought was great. You really can&rsquo;t go wrong with mozzarella and the crust was typical for Chicago-style.</p>

<p>Unfortunately these pictures do not do the pizza much justice and honestly they haven&rsquo;t for the last few posts I&rsquo;ve done. My camera is old and doesn&rsquo;t have a flash, so the odds are against it. I am in the process of creating a new process for this so stayed tuned.</p>
<p>Ultimately I enjoyed the pizza. I am at the point where I haven&rsquo;t had very much variety as for Chicago-style because I&rsquo;ve only had it a handful of times. So as far as I&rsquo;m concerned Handsome Henry&rsquo;s is right up there. Rachel wasn&rsquo;t very happy with the service there that night but I was as I got my food and beer in a timely manner. If you are in Muskegon and want to try something a little different I would suggest checking out the deep-dish they offer here. I&rsquo;m pretty sure its the only plan in town that offers Chicago-style. If I&rsquo;m wrong please let me know.</p>
<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
