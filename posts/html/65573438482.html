                    <p>Well I am officially 31 years old and it doesn&rsquo;t fell too bad. Ask me again in another 5 years and I might have a different outlook on things but for now I&rsquo;m good. And in leu of this milestone my parents wanted to take me out to eat. Since we were out of town in on my official birthday and I live in a different town than my folks, it had to wait a month.</p>

<p>As always, it was up to me to choose where we would go. I never really like doing this because I always feel like I am getting judged in a way. I&rsquo;m not sure why. That and I never really care. Like always, pizza sounded good, I was in Muskegon and I&rsquo;d heard of a new(ish) pizza place that had opened in the north part of town. <a href="https://www.handsomehobopizzeria.com/">Handsome Hobo&rsquo;s</a> is the name of the place. I suggested it, everyone agreed and that was that. </p>

<p>The name of this place may sound familiar. It was opened by the same group who opened <a href="http://joeymarinara.com/post/16193571936/handsome-henrys-deep-dish">Handsome Henry&rsquo;s</a> on the other side of town. It&rsquo;s a little different in that it specializes in pizzas. They also offer pasta dishes, salads and soups. We met my parents in the parking lot and went in and grabbed a booth. </p>

<p>After briefly taking a peak at their website before dinner I pretty much knew what I wanted by the time we ordered. I got a Chicago deep dish with pepperoni and black olive. All the deep dish pies come in a 10 inch size and you can order it however you want. </p>

<p>After about 20 minutes the pizza came out smelling absolutely great. I dug out a slice and went to town. It was warm, buttery and full of cheese. The sauce was kind of sweet and topped off with a sprinkle of seasoning and a little parmesan. I couldn&rsquo;t help think of how much it reminded me of Handsome Henry&rsquo;s because well, I&rsquo;m pretty sure it was the same pizza. But this wasn&rsquo;t a bad thing at all. In the end I took down two slices and was stuffed.</p>

<p>Not only was this a great birthday dinner but it was also the first time my son has tried pizza. A milestone in everyones life. It&rsquo;s located a little out of the way from most areas of Muskegon but if you ever find yourself in the northern section and are looking for a great meal I&rsquo;d suggest checking Handsome Hobo&rsquo;s out. If pizza or pasta&rsquo;s not your bag you can go across the parking lot to Hobo&rsquo;s and get a burger. I&rsquo;ve had one of them and highly recommend it.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 Slices</p>
