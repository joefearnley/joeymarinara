                                    <h1>Angelo's Italian Eatery</h1>
                    <p>Once again it&rsquo;s Friday night again and with nothing on the agenda pizza seemed like a good option for dinner. And once again I look to my growing (yet maybe shrinking a bit these days) to see what options are out there.</p>

<p>I remember talking to a couple of guys I know recently, they&rsquo;ve read the blog, and advised me to check out the place of employment sometime if I am looking for a decent pie. Even though a few other people chimed in to mentioned the grinders were the best menu option there, I thought i would give it a shot. The place is named <a href="http://angelositalianeatery.net/">Angelo&rsquo;s</a> and two locations in town, one happened to be only a couple of minutes from my house. I called up and ordered a large pepperoni pizza to be picked up in fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know exactly where this place was located, only an idea. The guy on the phone told me it&rsquo;s next a giant rock (or something to that effect) inside the BP station. It wasn&rsquo;t hard to find and once inside I realized that it was a little awkward to have a restaurant inside of a normal sized gas station. You walk in and bam it&rsquo;s right there. I didn&rsquo;t care too much, i wasn&rsquo;t eating there. I payed for the pizza, made a pit stop at the beer store across the street to pick up a forty, and headed home.</p>

<p>The pizza was somewhat of a New York style. Big slices still fresh and warm. The one thing that stuck out to me on this pizza was the sauce. It was thicker like that of a Glenside Pub or Martini&rsquo;s but with an almost sour flavor. I am usually psyched on the sweetness but this somehow worked out really well. The cheese was melted on nice and thick and with the thinner crust it made for a great pie.</p>

<p>I certainly going to be a repeat customer to Angelo&rsquo;s. Being only a few minutes away from my house and an enjoyable taste it&rsquo;s a hard one to pass up. Like I mentioned above the grinders get rave review so I will definitely have to check those out. I&rsquo;m a sucker for a great italian sandwich.</p>
