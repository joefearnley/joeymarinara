                    <p>I was sitting rush-hour traffic in Chicago waiting out the night to fly to Denver for a mini vacation with the in-laws, on my way a hotel. It was one of those park-and-fly things that apparently shuttles me to O'Hare the following morning. The cool thing is they have a bar next to the lobby and after a three hour drive combined with the summer heat I was ready for a beer. So I checked in to my room, dropped my bags off and headed back down to the lobby. Just before I stepped out I noticed a flyer for a local pizza place called <a href="http://www.grstandpizza.com/">Grand Stand</a>. It said on it that the place had voted best thin-crust pizza (or something to that effect) by Fox News. It sounded tempting but I was on a mission for a cold red and white so I continued on my way.</p>

<p>For some reason I had this idea in my head that I would meet other patrons at the bar that would  blow my mind with stories about mischief or world travel. Or perhaps the bar keep that would entertain me for a couple of hours. Unfortunately all I got was soccer on the TVs, a couple drunks at the end of the bar that seemed to be regulars and a bartender that barely spoke English. Figures. I was getting hungry and noticed pizza on the menu. Then I remembered the flyer I saw in my room and didn&rsquo;t see anything about being voted on so naturally I called Grand Stand, ordered a medium pepperoni, grabbed a couple of  cold ones to go and headed back to my room.</p>

<p>Within 10 minutes of arrving back to my room the pizza arrived at the door. I thanked the delivery dude, dropped the box on the bed, popped it open and dug in. It was still very warm. So much I that had to hold off for several minutes in few that I&rsquo;d fry the roof of my mouth. The taste was pretty and it was all due to the sauce. Heavy on the tomato and little sweetness to go along with it. The taste of garlic was a little to thick for my tastes though. As for the crust it was a little bland. I wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was the heat or what but something was off.</p>

<p>A few slices in realized that it was way too much pizza for me to take in. After two more and another beer I was ready to curl up in the fetal position. I was stuffed. Beer and pizzaed out. I closed up the pizza, drank my last beer and relaxed. I had a big weekend ahead of me. </p>

<p>I ended up taking down a couple more slices in the morning before hitting the shuttle. My advice would be to finish it off  Like I mentioned above, in a few hours I am off to Colorado for a bunch of days. One my list of things to do include eating at Illegal Pete&rsquo;s and at least one pizza joint. Wish my luck.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
