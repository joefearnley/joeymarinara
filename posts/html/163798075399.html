                                    <h1>Topshelf Liquor Bar & Pizza</h1>
                    <p>Last week I was my birthday and I turned the big 3 5. It was on a Sunday and even though I had Monday off of work, I had plans to go kayaking during the day and could not wrangler anyone up to do something Sunday night. So we decided to hit the town on Saturday and do some sort of bar crawl through downtown Muskegon.</p>

<p>The first stop was <a href="http://pigeonhillbrew.com">Pigeon Hill</a>. After a couple of beers there we went next door to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Top-Shelf-Downtown/421714761315792">Top Shelf</a> for food and more drinks. <a href="http://joeymarinara.com/post/39438321746/top-shelf-pizza-pub">I’ve written about Top Shelf before</a> when Ray and I hit their Apple Ave. location. A few years ago after Pigeon Hill set up shop downtown and they moved in next door shortly after as a second location in town.</p>

<p>They are known for their pizza and to be honest, I am not sure what else is on the menu. They don’t have a menu on the internet that I can find. I ended up ordering a personal pepperoni that was about 10 inches. After downing another beer the pizza came out.</p>

<p>The pizza was super greasy and it tasted fresh. The cheese was melted just about right. The crust was pretty soft and and combined with crispiness of the pepperoni it certainly left me wanting more after a couple of slices. In the end I ate most of the pizza even after filling up on beers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Top-Shelf-Downtown/421714761315792">Top Shelf</a> is a great addition to the downtown Muskegon scene. It not only provide good pizza next to a great brewery but it also has a full bar if that is thing. Although some of the other breweries and bars downtown are offering pizza, they were one of the first. If you find yourself downtown looking for a bite some time be sure to check out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Top-Shelf-Downtown/421714761315792">Top Shelf</a>.</p>
