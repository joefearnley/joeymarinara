                    <p>Last Sunday a couple of friends and I took a road trip to Chicago to see a rock show. I was pretty excited because there were a couple of things that made this show unique. For one, the show was at 1pm in the afternoon. It was what they called a “Matinee Show”. Obviously I heard of this for movies but never for a punk rock show. Second, the headlining band was Dead to Me, who many of us thought were broken up for years but got back together last year with the original singer (who is totally awesome), put out an EP, and are now on tour. Oh, and Arms Aloft were opening up which was like sprinkles on top.</p>

<p>Needless to say the show was awesome. All the bands were great and a cool thing about the venue was it was connected to a brewery so we also drank some pretty delicious beers during the show. It ended around 4pm and we had the rest of the day to do what we wanted. We checked into the hotel and headed out on the town.</p>

<p>After a quick stop at a bar near our hotel downtown, we headed to the north side to hit a couple favorites in that area. We hit The Blarney stone, the L&amp;L, a place that I don’t recall the name, then eventually ended up at a friend&rsquo;s apartment who lived nearby. We eventually made it back to the hotel and all were pretty hungry.</p> 

<p>After a suggestion from the front desk of the hotel, we ended up ordering a couple of pizzas from a place named <a href="#%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.pizanoschicago.com/%E2%80%9D">Pizano’s</a>. When I say we, I mean Steve, who ended up ordering two pizzas: one with meat and one without (to accommodate for Justin’s stance on animal rights). I’m not really sure how this translated to the employee taking the order but somehow we ended up with a thin crust pie with cheese and green olives and a deep dish with green pepper and onions. At this point in the night, I didn’t really care (and I’m fairly sure no one else did either) so I dug in.</p>

<p>I went for the cheese and olive pizza first. I happen to love green olives so this pizza was good with me. The crust was soft and thin with the cheese melted nicely. If I remember correctly there wasn’t much sauce on the pie. I think more sauce would have added more flavor to the saltiness of it.</p>

<p>Even though I don’t like green peppers or onion I decided to try a slice of the deep dish. Actually, I wasn’t even aware that onions were in it, but I powered through. There was plenty of sweet sauce and cheese on the deep dish which drowned out the flavors of those vegetables a bit. This pie wasn’t as deep as most of the style, which I liked. I wish we had different toppings on this one because I bet it would have been great.</p>

<p>When day drinking in Chicago in the middle of winter you really don’t know what to expect. I had a blast going to a show in the afternoon. I guess there is a first time for everything. As for <a href="#%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.pizanoschicago.com/%E2%80%9D">Pizano’s</a>, I can’t say I would recommend them over some of the pizza staples that reside in downtown Chicago. Although I did see them rated on <a href="#%E2%80%9Dhttp://chicago.eater.com/maps/chicagos-25-iconic-pizzerias%E2%80%9D">one</a> or <a href="#%E2%80%9Dhttp://chicago.eater.com/maps/best-chicago-style-pizza-restaurants%E2%80%9D">two</a> lists at <a href="#%E2%80%9Dhttp://chicago.eater.com/%E2%80%9D">Eater.com</a> so they must be doing something right.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
