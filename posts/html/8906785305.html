                    <p>Ahh, good ol&rsquo; Three Rivers. You see, I work in this quaint little town and when it comes to restaurant options, there&rsquo;s not a whole lot to offer. I typically go out to lunch one or two times a week. Once usually on Friday with a couple of other co-workers and sometimes another day that is usually a quick stop at Subway. As the years have gone on I&rsquo;ve found it more and more difficult to decide on where to eat. Even if its only on Fridays. </p>

<p>This Friday we picked this joint called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Frankies/204041644045">Frankie&rsquo;s</a>. It&rsquo;s located right on the railroad tracks as soon as you get into town. Some people might find this appealing, I found it very annoying when especially when it goes by in the middle of eating. To each it&rsquo;s own I suppose. Another thing that apparently interest people is that there is a railroad car connected to the back of the restaurant that you can sit in. I did once, it wasn&rsquo;t that cool.</p>

<p>Lately they have a deal going on where you get a small pizza, salad and drink of choice for $5.99. Both Zac and I found it enticing so we both ordered it. I got mine with pepperoni and black olives. The waitress gave me a choice between white or wheat crust. I was feeling frisky and went with the wheat later thinking what life would have been like for the next thirty minutes had I chosen differently.</p>

<p>The pizza was not bad. It was a small which was about 10 inches in diameter and I took it all in. My only complaint was they over did it a little on the black olives. So much I had to scrape a little off just to get it to my stomach. I&rsquo;ve had the pizza before in bigger form and from I remember was much better than the smaller version. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying I wouldn&rsquo;t try the pizza again at Frankie&rsquo;s. In fact, I&rsquo;ve taken up this same offer once since this review. The place is exactly a pizza joint. Just a nice little restaurant that has a bar and happen&rsquo;s to offer pizza. I do have to say the service could be improved. It took well over an hour just to get a couple salads and pizza pies. Just because it&rsquo;s one of the only places in town doesn&rsquo;t mean they won&rsquo;t open a Jasper&rsquo;s around the corner. Oh wait.</p>
