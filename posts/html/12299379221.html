                    <p>So the hockey season officially started. The NHL that is. And this year I have officially joined a fantasy league along with some pals of mine. I&rsquo;m fairly new to the whole fantasy sports thing. The only other experience I&rsquo;ve had in fantasy-based sports (or fanasy-based anything for that matter) was a few years ago when guy at work asked me if I wanted to join their football league. I payed attention for a couple of weeks and that was about all I could take. I pay more attention to hockey so when the opportunity came up to join a league, I thought &ldquo;What the hell!?&rdquo;. So there I was, at <a href="http://null">Big Deals</a><a href="http://www.bigdealssportsbar.com/"></a> sucking down some brew dogs ready to face some fast-paced action. </p>

<p>Those of you who have never bee to Big Deals, there&rsquo;s not much to explain. It&rsquo;s THE stereotypical sports bar with over thirty TVs and a large portrait of Derek Jeter that looks a lot like a birthday cake on the wall. Most will hate the place but if you are looking to watch a game of any sort and find really cheap beer to accommodate that, this place is for you. If there is a game on that you don&rsquo;t see on one of the TVs you can always work something out with the bartender or one of the waitresses. And when i say cheap beer I mean the best beer specials in town. Seriously, I would put this place up against any other bar in town as far as the specials are concerned. Multiples every damn night.</p>

<p>As for the pizza, well that is a different story. I was a little weary about ordering it. Actaully I was weary about ordering anything on the menu. The food is one thing I can&rsquo;t really say anything good about. But I needed to order something and Dave recommended the pizza as he had it the week before on his lunch break. So I ordered one up with pepperoni and cheese.</p>

<p>The pizza only comes in a 12 inch size and like everything else I&rsquo;ve had on the menu, it was pretty mediocre. I was really hungry at the time otherwise I probably would have eaten one slice and boxed up the rest. But I was and after a few tall beers I ended up blazing through half the pie. Fulfilling for the night at least.</p>

<p>If you are ever looking for a place to watched the game or just grab some cheap beers, you should check out Big Deals. I would stay away from the pizza tough. It&rsquo;s just no good. Hit up the wings if you need to grab something to eat and don&rsquo;t be afraid to order a Hamm&rsquo;s, it will only cost you a dollar.</p>
