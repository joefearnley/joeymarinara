                    <p>After my birthday extravaganza last weekend, I took a few days off of work the next week to spend some time at home with the little ones. My sister-in-law offered to watch them for a few hours while I ran a few errands on my own. And when I say “run a few errands” I mean go to the guitar store. I figured I could time it so I could grab some lunch while I was out. As if I hadn’t had enough pizza for the few days before, I decided to look for a place I haven’t been to before.</p>

<p>The first place I hit was in Grandville and I’ve wanted to try the pizza at Osgood Brewing for a while. I stopped in once for a beer there once and remember seeing people ordering the pizza and it looking and smelling really good. Unfortunately all they sell are full pizzas and I really wasn’t hungry enough or in the mood to eat one myself (especially compounded with a beer or two). Then I remembered there was another pizza place nearby that I have driven by a few times - <a href="http://%E2%80%9D" https:>Primo Pizza</a>.</p>

<p>As I pulled into Grandville I drove by where I remembered the place being hoping will was still there. It was and I pulled in to see what pies they had on tap. There was a pepperoni, deluxe, and meat lovers read to go. I ordered a slice of the pepperoni and meat lovers, threw a little parmesan on and headed out to find a parking lot to eat it in.</p>

<p>The slices were surprising big. Probably the size of half of what I would get at Osgood’s so I could assure myself I made the right decision. The crust was soft and floury. I was able to get a nice bend when biting into the slice. The cheese was melted to that perfect point and the peperoni added a nice kick to each bite. The cheese was on thick too. In each bite I got a more than enough with just minimal amount of sauce was great.</p>

<p>If I lived or worked in the area, <a href="http://%E2%80%9D" https:>Primo</a> would be a go-to spot for me. The two slices were around $5 and was more than enough for a meal. If pizza isn’t your thing they also offer wings, Stromboli, salads, full Italian dinners, and even a little Mexican. If you live or work in the area do yourself a favor and check <a href="http://%E2%80%9D" https:>Primo Pizza</a> for all of that pizza goodness you could ever expect.</p>

<p><strong>Final Rating:</strong> 3 slices</p>
