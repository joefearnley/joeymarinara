                                    <h1>Sal’s Pizza & Restaurant</h1>
                    <p>A couple of weeks ago my family took a trip down to Nashville Tennessee. The first day was pretty much all travel. Nashville is really on 8 hours away (by car) but with two little kids it was an all day event. One of the things we wanted to do on the trip was visit the Mammoth Caves in Kentucky. So after spending the first night in Cave City, we made that visit on the first part of the second day then finally arrived in Nashville.</p>

<p>On the agenda for the first night in town was a outdoor concert on the north side of town. Ray had headed to the store to stock up on supplies for the week and I was left to figure out dinner. I wasn’t planning eating much pizza on this trip but as we pulled into town I noticed a place named <a href="#%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.salsnashville.com/%E2%80%9D">Sal’s</a> that was pretty much around the corner. They happened to have a deal that night offering two large pizzas for $25. I took them up on that and picked the pizzas up 15 minutes later. The timing was great because Ray was retying from the store as I pulled into the driveway with the pies.</p>

<p>As soon as I got the food inside everyone dug in. The pizza had a soft, thin crust. It had plenty of cheese and was super greasy. The sauce didn’t have much taste to it, but I think the grease taste was stemming from the cheese and pepperoni combination that was really good. I couldn’t help making a strong comparison to Papa John’s with it.</p>

<p>After several days of travel, hipster burgers, record stores, country music, beer, whiskey, and barbecue, I was kind of happy to be heading home. I highly recommend taking a trip to Nashville if you get a chance because there is a ton to do in town. And apparently there is more to do by the day. Speaking of which, if you do go, make sure to plan your day around the traffic because the place currently has more people than infrastructure. As for the pizza, I didn’t dig deep, but ultimately found some be coincidence and necessity. Maybe I’ll do better next time.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
