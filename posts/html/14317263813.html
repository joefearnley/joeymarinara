                    <p>I&rsquo;ve never been on a blind date before. I&rsquo;ve been in that weird situation where friends want to play cupid and have you meet the friend of a friend in a social situation but never an actual blind date. What I have been on, a few times actually, is what I like to call the double blind date. It&rsquo;s the double date where your significan other has a friend or co-worker and you&rsquo;ve never met them or their significant other. These situations have the potential to be disastrous.  I mean think about it. You are about to spend like 4 hours with some one you have never met and are sort of forced to chum up with. And on top of that I am told I need to pace my self with the drinks so I don&rsquo;t make an ass of myself. </p>

<p>Weeks prior to this double blind date I ended up on, we had to decide on a place to eat. I think everyone else wanted to class it up a little bit, so Harvey&rsquo;s was out. A new joint recently opened in the ever-growing area of downtown Kalamazoo that has been coined as &ldquo;The Entertainment District&rdquo; (which I haven&rsquo;t figured out if it was coined that or it&rsquo;s the name of a business) called <a href="http://www.thegatsby.biz/">The Gatsby</a>. Its tagline is &ldquo;A Modern Speakeasy&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t about you but that sounds like the lamest thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard. By the time we got there, got seated and ordered some drinks I kind of figured out what they were going for but still was a little confused. There was a hostess dressed like a whore from the &lsquo;20&rsquo;s and a bunch of dudes running around with bow ties and arm bands on. I don&rsquo;t know much about the speakeasy movement other than what I&rsquo;ve seen on Boardwalk Empire so as far as I was concerned this was spot on. With a modern twist I suppose. Regardless we were hungry and asked for some menus.</p>

<p>The menu was was a simple one. It contain one of everything from steak to chicken to pasta to burger. I wasn&rsquo;t going there planning on eating pizza but when I saw it on the menu it was the most interesting thing that was going to put me in the back of my seat and not want to get up. Plus I didn&rsquo;t know if we were going anywhere after and I wasn&rsquo;t about to let a big meal drag me down. So I decided on the The Hideout.</p>

<p>The Hideout is a &ldquo;house&rdquo; pizza with whole tomato slices, buffalo mozzarella cheese and &ldquo;red sauce&rdquo; on Naan bread. The &ldquo;red sauce&rdquo; was more or less a sweet marinara, the cheese was good and thick, and the tomatoes were, well, tomatoes. Which is why this pizza didn&rsquo;t really do it for me. I&rsquo;m not really into tomatoes. In fact I usually request it not to be added to any dish I order. It was an appetizer so the amount was right but if you were looking to stuff your face I&rsquo;d suggest ordering from the main courses. It was a little different and filled me up just enough, that&rsquo;s what liked about it.</p>

<p>The double date ended up turning out alright. We all got along great and I paced myself on the brew dogs. As for the pizza, I don&rsquo;t think I would get it here again. If you are <i>really</i> into tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella you might give it a go. If you are in downtown Kalamazoo and in the mood for pizza, there are plenty of other options in the area. If you end up at The Gatsby and are you planning on eating I&rsquo;d suggest the kobe burger with bacon, you won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
