                    <p>We finally wrapped things up and headed back to the hotel room to gear up for the evening. At this point in the Vegas trip things start to get a little fuzzy. At one point security showed up and told us to the keep the music down. To me, it can&rsquo;t get loud enough but the surrounding rooms didn&rsquo;t really agree. We eventually left the hotel and ended up at this place called Minus 5 in Mandalay Bay. We all had to wear these giant parkas with gloves to get in. Turns out it&rsquo;s basically an igloo with a bar in it. Somehow I managed to take my coat off along with my shirt so some lady could take my picture. I am not sure where but if you dig hard enough I am sure you can find them.</p>

<p>After the ice bar we headed to New York New York. We posted up at this piano bar where I got the guy to play Bruce Springsteen after tipping him. We (I guess mainly I) danced for a while trying to get the soul train line going (which never works) and finally decided it was time to move on.</p>

<p>On our way out we noticed <a href="http://newyorknewyork.com/restaurants/ny-pizzeria.aspx">a pizzeria</a> offering slices. Steve asked if I wanted a slice and it sounded like the perfect dinner. I ordered a slice of pepperoni and a water (like that would help me at this point) then headed over to grab and seat and dig in. Unfortunately I don&rsquo;t&rsquo; remember much of the pizza. It was a larger square slice with a medium thickness. I also remember it being decent enough to eat very quickly. I managed to actually take a picture but it did not turn out at all so unfortunately have nothing to show. You just have to trust me on this one.</p>

<p>Dave and Jason opted for sushi and steak. Turns out something wasn&rsquo;t cooked right and they both got a little food poisoning the next morning. Flying and basically traveling all day is never good when you are hungover and/or food poisoned. Just ask those two.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
