                    <p>Summer is beginning to rear its ugly head here in West Michigan and last weekend the family and I took our first trip to the beach this year. The wind was blowing was strong so the waves were fun (and exhausting) to swim in. On the way home we had to decide what was for dinner and pizza seemed like the easiest solution. There are a couple of places in Fruitport that I’ve been wanting to checkout so I checked to see what was available at the time. Ultimately we decided on <a href="#%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.facebook.com/Peppies-Pizza-and-sub-shop-185176161540834/%E2%80%9D">Peppie&rsquo;s</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.facebook.com/Peppies-Pizza-and-sub-shop-185176161540834/%E2%80%9D">Peppie&rsquo;s</a> is located in I guess what would be considered downtown Fruitport and seems to be somewhat of a staple there. They offer pizza, subs, salads, and burritos. They had a deal on a large, three topping pizza so ordered one of there with pepperoni, bacon, and ham on it. <a href="#%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.facebook.com/Peppies-Pizza-and-sub-shop-185176161540834/%E2%80%9D">Peppie&rsquo;s</a> itself is your typical hole-in-the-wall pizza joint with a counter, plenty of seating, and an arcade machine. I swung in there and picked up the pizza on our way home from the beach.</p>

<p>Once we got home I dug right in. The pizza was loaded with toppings. The meats were quality with the bacon a little crispy but still had a little chew to it. The sauce added some good flavor and the cheese wasn’t bad but it had a 10-15 minute car ride so it had thickened up a bit by the time I got it home. My only complaint with the pizza was that the crust was dry, chewy, and had absolutely no flavor.</p>

<p>Reading some of the reviews online it seems that <a href="#%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.facebook.com/Peppies-Pizza-and-sub-shop-185176161540834/%E2%80%9D">Peppies</a> has a pretty good reputation. You kind of have to in order to stick around for so long. I wouldn’t go out of my way to eat <a href="#%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.facebook.com/Peppies-Pizza-and-sub-shop-185176161540834/%E2%80%9D">Peppie&rsquo;s</a> but if you are in the area or perhaps the bar next door I’d suggest trying it out.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
