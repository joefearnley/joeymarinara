                                    <h1>Bilbo's Heart-Shaped Pie</h1>
                    <p>Valentines days is here again. I&rsquo;m not going to go into details about how I feel about the &ldquo;holiday&rdquo; personally because <a href="http://blog.joefearnley.com/post/1039777381/sunday-social-32-valentimes-day">I&rsquo;ve done that before</a> but let&rsquo;s just say I&rsquo;m not a big fan (and I don&rsquo;t think very many guys are). No plans were really in place for the evening. I was thinking about just cooking something but then Rachel brought up the idea of getting pizza. She mentioned that Bilbo&rsquo;s was advertising heart-shaped pies for the occasion and upon further thought along with hunger kicking in pizza was sound better and better. Every year I get coupons from Papa John&rsquo;s and Papa Murphy&rsquo;s for these pies so there were options. We decided to check out Bilbo&rsquo;s and if it was busy we&rsquo;d use one of the others as a fallback.</p>

<p>We arrived at Bilbo&rsquo;s and it surprisingly wasn&rsquo;t that busy. I guess for a Tuesday night it was busier than normal but nothing too bad. We bellied up to the bar to avoid any waiting and inquired about the heart-shaped pie. The bartender explained that its about nine inches cut into four slices. Perfect. We ordered one up along with a side salad to start and a Magic Hat Number 9. If you&rsquo;ve never tried the Bilbo&rsquo;s salad before I&rsquo;d suggest doing so. It&rsquo;s a basic salad with a &ldquo;distinctive&rdquo; dressing. The dressing is like a sweeter vinaigrette that is somewhat creamy. What ever it&rsquo;s made of it&rsquo;s damn good.</p>

<p>Finally the pizza came out. It was the pan style served in a heart-shaped pan. I&rsquo;m not going to go into too much detailed about the taste because it was basically the same as I&rsquo;ve had there before. Rachel thought it was undercooked but I think that is just the style of crust they make there. Maybe they were thrown of with the different pan but who knows. It was your basic pepperoni pizza, pretty darn good.</p>

<p>Finally I would like to again, comment on the service of Bilbo&rsquo;s. Whoever has control over this whether its the owner, manager, whatever&hellip;.hiring college kids who don&rsquo;t know what they are doing and don&rsquo;t give a shit about customers makes for a horrible dining experience. I think it&rsquo;s a locally-owned business so I would think you would take some pride in your customer base and community. Being voted the best pizza town in the mid-2000&rsquo;s is not going to last forever.</p>
