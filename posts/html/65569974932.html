                                    <h1>Old Chicago</h1>
                    <p>I&rsquo;ve written many times before how much I like deep dish, Chicago style pizza. When I heard about an <a href="http://oldchicago.com/">Old Chicago</a> opening up in Portage it was immediately on my list of places to check out. Which, about a year ago, I actually did and didn&rsquo;t end up writing about it because I lost the pictures when my phone got got. I&rsquo;ve also been to the one in Grand Rapids before but that was for a quick lunch and didn&rsquo;t order any pizza. </p>

<p>On this fine evening, in order to get full use of my Mongo Mug we decided on Bd&rsquo;s for some Mongolian BBQ. Once we got seated it was very apparent how warm it was inside. Usually the place it a little toasty because of the open flame in the middle of the room and it is the warmest part of the year but still, it was hot. We ordered some beers and after mentioning something to the waitress about the heat she said the air conditioning is having issues and it currently broken. We all kind of decided this was not going to turn out well, especially with a baby joining in on the fun so we decided to pull the plug on Bd&rsquo;s and head across the street to <a href="http://oldchicago.com/">Old Chicago</a>.</p>

<p>Old Chicago is a national chain serving american food with pizza as the main offering. Like I mentioned above I&rsquo;d been here before and wasn&rsquo;t too impressed with it. They do however have a pretty cool bar area offering all kinds of different beers. And if you don’t dig the pizza they a pretty large menu with a ton of great looking food. </p>

<p>We got seated, ordered a round of drinks and starting looking over the menu. Of course I wanted to try the deep dish again but Ray wasn’t feeling it. There was no way I was going to take one of these pies down myself and didn’t feel like trying. Dave was with us and offered to split one with me as long as we got some extra toppings. I agreed and we ordered up a deep dish pizza with pepperoni, sausage, black olives and green onion. Ray opted for the bbq chicken. </p>

<p>Several minutes later the pies came out. I grabbed a slice and dig in. After the first bite I noticed a striking resemblance between this pizza and Pizza Hut’s pan style. Dave said the same thing. Once something like that gets stuck in your head it is hard to get it out. It was good though. It was cooked to perfection with a thick, buttery, chewy crust that always gets a good spot in my book. I’ve not a fan of vegetables on my pizza so I tried to avoid the green peppers as much as I could. Sometimes you just can’t though.</p>

I remember a time when Pizza Hut used to be my favorite. The pan style specifically. Over the years though, and I’m not sure what happened, but it just isn’t good. And honestly, Old Chicago’s “Chicago thick crust” is along the same lines, but certainly a step up. I would suggest this place to anyone looking for some good food with a nice beer selection. Unfortunately, I wouldn’t suggest going there for the pizza. Next time I think I’ll try a calzone.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
