                    <p>Summer is finally starting to peak it&rsquo;s pretty head in around these parts. As the little one begins to get more mobile we have been taking the party outside when we get the chance. I&rsquo;ve been laying off the pizza in hopes of dropping some weight before the bulk of the summer (and vacation) but I&rsquo;ve craving it a bit lately. Ray had mentioned that one of the local parks where some guy was making pizzas. Park plus pizza is a score in my book so we decided to head over to Oshtemo Township Park to meet some friends for a family picnic.</p>

<p>The park was not easy to find as it&rsquo;s located behind the fire department off M43. As you pull in it is hard to miss the pizza oven mounted on a trailer surrounded by hungry disc golfers with a big sign that says <a href="http://www.camziespizza.com/">Camzie&rsquo;s</a>. We found a parking spot and set up shop near the baseball field. I was on call for work at the time and got occupied with that so Ray went up and ordered a pie for us. I eventually caught up with them and found out she had ordered an 11 inch with pepperoni and banana peppers. I thought it was a good choice and we hung out while the chef prepared it.</p>

<p>From what I could tell the options were 9 or 11 inch with a variety of options. I think they also offered salads. The pizzas are wood-fired and after asking about about what kind of wood he used he mentioned he actually cuts it down him self on some land near his house (the actual type escapes me at the moment). The conversation then turned a little personal and I kind of tuned out and before I knew the pizza was ready to go. I grabbed a couple of plates and napkins and headed over to where we were sitting.</p>

<p>I was starving and dug right in which was a bad idea because it was literally right out of the oven and extremely hot. I burned my mouth a little but powered through the first slice. The second one a little cooler and I could actually make out the taste. The crust was super crunchy and the sauce was rich. I think there could have been a bit more cheese included but the combination of the pepperoni and banana peppers totally made up for it. In the end I think I ended up taking down 4 slices.</p>

<p>I read <a href="http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2013/04/cazmies_pizza_a_new_mobile_woo.html">the back story on Camzie&rsquo;s</a> and it&rsquo;s a pretty cool one. He took an idea and ran with it providing the local community with some they like. Talking with the guy he said when not at a special event he is at Flesher Field during the day and Oshtemo Township Park for dinner time. If you have time to kill at the park or just want to swing in to pick up a great wood-fired pizza I would certainly check out Camzie&rsquo;s</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
