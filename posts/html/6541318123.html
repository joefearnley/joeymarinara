                                    <h1>Wayside West</h1>
                    <p>It&rsquo;s Friday night, warm summer night approaching and Dave, Rachel and I are looking to grab some dinner. This particular night was not only the art hop in downtown Kalamazoo but it was the big one where they close down the mall and fill it with all of the stupid white tents that are filled with crap only middle-aged women want to buy.  I know these people (or artists) are trying to make money selling this stuff but I think they need to order some originality.</p>

<p>Needless to say every downtown joint was filled to capacity including Harvey&rsquo;s. It was a beautiful night and we (they) really wanted to sit outside, so downtown wasn&rsquo;t happening. We decided our next best bet was Gallagher&rsquo;s bomb-ass beer garden. On our way there though we passed <a href="http://waysidewest.com/">The Wayside</a>. I haven&rsquo;t spent much time at the Wayside except for a few Wednesday nights in college and I certainly haven&rsquo;t tried the pizza there but they do have seating along the outside of the building, so we thought why not give it ago. Plenty of people watching from up there. Well, that and car watching.</p>

<p>The Wayside offers pizza in 10, 14, and 16 inch sizes with your choice of toppings at $1 a pop. They also offer garlic, parmesan, and cajun style crust. Dave and I decided to split a 14&quot; with pepperoni and bacon. The waitress agreed it was a good choice but I highly doubt she&rsquo;s ever had the shit.</p> 

<p>The pizza came out fresh from the oven and it was hot as all get out. One of the first things I noticed was how greasy it was. I wasn&rsquo;t complaining as I thought it added to the flavor. The most appealing part of the pie was the cheese. The sauce on the other hand, that needed some work. The toppings were toppings&hellip;.somewhere in middle.</p>

</p>

<p> Ultimately, I thought pizza landed somewhere in the middle on the slice scale. Nothing except maybe the cheese gave it a enough to tip it in any direction and it wasn&rsquo;t enough. So there it will stay.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
