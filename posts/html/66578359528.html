                                    <h1>Uccello's</h1>
                    <p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe it has been a year since Zig was born. The years get faster and faster and this past one is a true sign of that. For the little guy&rsquo;s birthday Ray brought him to Grand Rapids so we could have lunch together. Their plan was to hit the Grandville mall afterward so I suggested some places near there.</p>

<p>After hearing nothing but good things about it, I decided on <a href="http://www.uccellos.com/">Uccello&rsquo;s</a>. They offer a lunch buffet on Friday&rsquo;s (maybe other days too, I&rsquo;m not sure). I met up with the others around noon at the Grandville location, near the mall, and grabbed a table. </p>

<p>The waiter mentioned they offer a lunch buffet that included pizza, pasta, salad, soup and prime rib. I could always order off the menu but I was basically there for pizza and I know the group wouldn&rsquo;t be able to decide on anything. So I went with the buffet.</p>

<p>My first trip up I went with a salad and a little pasta to test the waters. It wasn&rsquo;t bad and the buffet area wasn&rsquo;t that busy. My second trip up I grabbed a couple slices of pepperoni and hunk of the stuffed pie (or maybe it was a calzone, I&rsquo;m not sure). At this point, the buffet was filling up with people.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t really blown away by my bit few bites. I&rsquo;ve noticed at a few pizza buffets, they cut the pies into really thin slices. This doesn&rsquo;t do it for me. I fell like it takes away from the pie a little bit. Regardless, it was good. I especially liked the stuffed pie. It was crispy the cheese was melted nicely, oozing out the sides. I don&rsquo;t recall what exactly was inside. I know for sure there was pepperoni and ham that added a nice salty punch. </p>

<p>Finally, stuffed, I still managed to drive in a couple slices of prime rib. In the ended I think I had at least four slices of pizza (two pepperoni, two ham and bacon), two hunks of the stuffed pie along with a salad.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d suggest everyone check out Uccello&rsquo;s, at least for their lunch buffet. Buffet&rsquo;s are a little dangerous so I try to stay away from them as much as I can. But this one was good. And they offered prime rib sliced for you on the spot. I think next time I&rsquo;ll go for dinner and check out what other options they have for pizza.  </p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 Slices</p>
