                    <p>The summer is in full swing and Muskegon is gearing up for the annual Bike Time event that goes on in the downtown area. For those unfamiliar with the event it is a weekend of motorbikes, music, and debauchery. The event also brings to town a bunch of different food vendors and last Friday some co-workers talked about grabbing some lunch there.</p> 

<p>Word on the street was there is a pizza place opening up some time inside Unruly Brewing and said pizza place was opening up shop next to the brewery for the weekend. After some discussion a group of us headed out to get some pizza and maybe even a beer or two. </p>

<p>The name of the pizza place is <a href="http://www.rebelpies.com/" target="_blank">Rebel Pies</a> and plans to be open in the next month or so. On this particular day they were set up in the beer garden area of Unruly offering slices of pizza and chicken wings. The wings selection was pretty basic but the pies this place was offering is quite different than what is usually offered around here.</p>

<p>They did not have all of their options available at the time but the ones I remember were pepperoni, vegetarian, and something named the Polynesian Farmer. I did not feel like being basic on this day so I opted for the Polynesian Farmer. The pizza has a basic crust, a little on the thicker side with the topping including red sauce, mozzarella cheese, goat cheese, bacon, prosciutto, basil, a pineapple slice then topped with a sriracha aioli.</p>

<p>After the first bite I realized they were on to something. The crust was cooked just right and it only had a hint of marinara on it. I don’t think I have ever had prosciutto on pizza before and man was it a nice touch, especially combined with the bacon chunks. The goat cheese mixed with the salty meats was also a great combination and the hint of spice the aioli added was a great touch. I’m not much of a fan of fruit on the pizza so I could have done without the pinnaple but I was so hungry I just took it down. I only needed one slice of this monster. </p>

<p>I am pretty excited about what <a href="http://www.rebelpies.com/" target="_blank">Rebel Pies</a> is bringing to the brewery. It is always good to have a food option while drinking craft beer. Unruly sells sandwiches, which are great (thanks to Fatty’s), but the ability to get a slice is awesome. Be on the lookout for <a href="http://www.rebelpies.com/" target="_blank">Rebel Pies</a> opening later this year. I know I will be coming back</p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
