                    <p>Last night was a special occasion. It was Rachel&rsquo;s birthday and we didn&rsquo;t really have any plans. The only thing I knew is that she wanted to go out to eat for dinner and have a few drinks.  The big question, like always, was where to go. We were looking for a little more finer dining for the evening and decided on Epic Bistro. </p>

<p>This place is located on the Kalamazoo mall around the corner from where I used to live. Which is why I was surprised I had never been to this joint before. I have been next door to the newer Central City Tap House on a few occasions and after reviewing the menu I kind of remembered why I haven&rsquo;t been here before: it&rsquo;s a bit pricier than your local pub. Last night was no exception especially after the bottle of bubbly. </p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t starving by any means and after reviewing the menu, I  saw they indeed had pizza on the list. In fact they actually have this special wood-fired oven that they cook the pies in. Unfortunately pepperoni and cheese was not on the menu. It was a toss up between the four cheese and the pizzeto blanco. I opted for the blanco and rolled with it.</p>

<p>I requested no peppers or onions because well, that&rsquo;s how I do. Vegetables are good for you so why would I eat them? Anyway, this particular pizza was made with mornay sauce which is some sort of cheesy white sauce that when mixed with the chicken, bacon and a toasted crust was a perfect surprise. If you ever get the chance I would suggest giving the blanco a whirl, you won&rsquo;t be disappointed. </p>
