                    <p>Winter has finally reared its ugly head around these parts and the end of the year is quickly approaching. My plan is to start a diet at the beginning of next year so I am trying to squeeze in a few more pizza meals beforehand. Last Saturday night when deciding what to do for dinner, Ray said it was my choice. I was looking for a pizza place I have not had before and decided on a place named <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Kentlys-Pizza-Subs-1569679623256130/">Kently&rsquo;s</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve had my eye on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Kentlys-Pizza-Subs-1569679623256130/">Kently’s</a> for a while. I actually tried to get them to deliver to my house a couple of months back because I couldn’t drive anywhere at the moment and got denied because I lived too far away. This time I was going to order take out. I noticed back then that they had weird hours and it was late but luckily they were still open.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Kentlys-Pizza-Subs-1569679623256130/">Kently&rsquo;s</a> is located in what you would call the downtown area of Fruitport, MI in a location that has been a few different pizza-related  joints over the years. They offer pizza, subs, salads, and wings and are take-out and delivery only. I ordered a basic, 16 inch, pepperoni and cheese pie and picked it up about 15 minutes later. The inside of the building is simple with only a counter and couple of guys behind it watching TV. I paid for the pie and headed home to eat.</p>

<p>They make their pizza with the cheese over the toppings, which can be good at times. The crust was party cut and a bit on the soft side. The cheese was cooked well and tightened up a bit by the time I got home but was still very tasty. The pepperoni was also cooked well. It was thin and not crispy probably because it was under the cheese while being cooked. I ate about 3 or 4 pieces before I decided to throw in the towel.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Kentlys-Pizza-Subs-1569679623256130/">Kently&rsquo;s</a> is located in a good spot. There are not a lot of options for pizza in that area of Fruitport so I’m sure they get plenty of business. I thought the pizza was pretty good but Ray, like most places, did not. This means I probably won’t be eating it anytime soon (possibly ever again). Maybe if it was closer. Regardless, if you are in Fruitport and haven’t tried <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Kentlys-Pizza-Subs-1569679623256130/">Kently’s</a> yet, and are looking for something different, I say got for it.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
