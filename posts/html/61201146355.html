                    <p>Summer is in full swing at the moment. The weather hasn&rsquo;t been great around these parts this summer but there&rsquo;s a lot of time left so I for one am hopeful. One of the big events the summer holds for me is a trip to the country&rsquo;s west coast combined with the wedding of my pal Steve. Prior to the wedding they were holding a shower on the east side of Michigan in a town called Whitmore Lake.</p>

<p>Whitmore Lake is located off the highway somewhere between Brighton, MI and Ann Arbor, MI. I&rsquo;ve actually been there before during a work-related trip last summer. There&rsquo;s not much to the town but a small store, video rental place, Best Western (where we were staying) and a bar and grille called Captain Joe&rsquo;s. After hanging out on the lake all day we actually ended up back here for a nightcap and some food.</p>

<p>To me, Captain&rsquo;s Joe was a little confusing I initially had to run in there to get some take out to bring back to the hotel room. I was then going to meet my Nikki and Justin back at the bar where apparently there was a band playing. I came back, ordered a beer and waited until they showed up. About 10 minutes later, with the place being half full and no band in sight, I texted them to see what their status was. They informed me they were at Captain Joe&rsquo;s in the lounge. I found out from the Bartender there is another section to the bar in which you have to go outside and around the building to the entrance.</p>

<p>Confused, I finished my beer and walked around to the other side. As I entered I was greeted by Justin, Nikki and a half-eaten pizza. They asked me if I wanted any and of course I said yes. It was pepperoni and still pretty warm. From what I could remember it was pretty ordinary. The sauce was a little on dull side and the crust still quite warm and chewy. My taste buds had basically been through the ringer that day and I had several cold ones so at that point I think anything would have tasted good.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have much to say about Captain Joe&rsquo;s. It seems like one of the only spots in Whitmore Lake to hang out. From what I could tell seafood was something they were more known for than pizza. Be aware though. Like many things in life there are two sides to it and from my short time there can&rsquo;t really tell you which one&rsquo;s the best.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
