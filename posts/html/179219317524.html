                    <p>Last weekend was an interesting one. We drove down to New Buffalo to visit our friends Steve and Lisa who are about to become new parents. They were doing a baby shower inviting all of their friends and family who wanted to come. Ray and I looked at this as a weekend to get away without the kids that is if we could secure a sitter which we did.</p>

<p>We went down on Friday night and the shower was on Saturday which they were having at the New Buffalo Yacht Club. The place was rented for a few hours and after lunch and the opening of gifts most of us hit the bar area and started to have some cocktails. They place was only ours for another hour so we ended up taking the party down the road to the local Veterans Club.</p>

<p>After a few hours of drinking and socializing, Ray started to get hungry and mentioned ordering some pizzas. Everyone seemed to be on board with pizza, so we called up <a href="https://www.romanewbuffalo.com/">Roma Pizza</a> and ordered a bunch of pies. I didn’t do the ordering so I don’t remember how many or what kind of pies we order by about an hour later a ton of pizza showed up.</p>

<p>After the crowd cleared I went up and grabbed a couple slices of the pepperoni. The pizza was super greasy and had a ton of flavor. The cheese was melted perfectly and there was plenty of it. Something in the pizza gave it a spicy kick. I don’t know if that was the sauces or the pepperoni or the combination of the two. Regardless, it added just enough to make the slices really tasty.</p>

<p>Other than the short stop in town, this was my first official trip to New Buffalo. By the end of the weekend I think we covered it all (which isn’t much). Unfortunately the weather was pretty bad so we had to spend all the time indoors and a boat ride was definitely out of the question. I don’t know what the other options for pizza are in New Buffalo but if you’re in town and looking for a decent pie I would certainly consider checking out <a href="https://www.romanewbuffalo.com/">Roma</a>.</p>


<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
