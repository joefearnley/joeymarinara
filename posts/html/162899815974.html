                                    <h1>Petrino’s</h1>
                    <p>After not going out to lunch during the week for a few months the other day I decided to splurge and head out for some pizza. I’ve been checking out some of the local spots to see what is out there. One place I had driven by was named <a href="http://%E2%80%9D" http:>Petrino’s</a> on the southside of Holland not far from downtown. I noticed they had a sign in the window that read “Pizza by the Slice” so when my hunger pains started to kick in I head 
toward downtown.</p>

<p><a href="http://%E2%80%9D" http:>Petrino’s</a> has multiple locations around Holland. Or at least I think they do. According to <a href="http://%E2%80%9D" http:>their website</a> there are two locations: one Holland and one in Zeeland. The confusing thing is, one of the locations in Holland is actually named <em>Don</em> Petrino’s. Regardless all locations offer pizza, stromboli, subs, salads, and pasta.</p>

<p>The location I went to is located is when looks like a house in a small business district. When I arrived they had a couple of pies in the rotator – a meat lovers and a deluxe – along with a couple orphan slices. They had a deal going on where for $5 you get two slices of pizza and a drink. I ordered two slices of the pepperoni, sausage, and bacon along with a can of Diet Coke.</p>

<p>After adding a little red pepper to the slices I found a see and started eating. The pizza was fresh. So fresh that it burned the roof of my mouth a little bit. After letting it cool down a bit I started back up. The first thing I noticed was the crust. For as big as the slices were, the crust was still crispy on the bottom, giving it a little crunch when you bit in. The combination of the cheese and meat gave it that oily, greasy flavor that I love on pizza. I even had to give the slices a fold at the beginning to get a good bite. After two slices I was plenty full.</p>

<p><a href="http://%E2%80%9D" http:>Petrino’s</a> has a lot of potential. The location I visited was newly renovated with plenty of seating which is good because it was pretty full for a Wednesday. With the plethora of pizza options in the Holland area, <a href="http://%E2%80%9D" http:>Petrino’s</a> should not be overlooked. They offer great, New York style pizza for a decent price. You can’t find just anywhere.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
