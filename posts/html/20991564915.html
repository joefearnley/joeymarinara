                                    <h1>Jac Cekola's</h1>
                    <p>I attended my first <a href="http://www.codeandkegs.com/">hackathon</a> a couple of weeks ago and had a hell of time. Maybe too good of a time. Saturday was a little blurring and needless to say by the time I woke up on Sunday I was ready to eat something strong. Pizza was on the mind and I just heard about this place out in Portage that had just opened up. I somehow talked Rachel into and off we went.</p>

<p>I choose a place called <a href="http://www.jacscekolaspizza.com/">Jac&rsquo;s Cekola&rsquo;s</a>. Apparently this place has some history. I won&rsquo;t go into details (you can read all about it on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/JACs-Cekolas-Pizza/338935399471427?sk=info">facebook page</a>) but some version of it has been around Kalamazoo for a few decades. The latest incarnation occupies what was once Cruiser&rsquo;s Pub. This time though there is no main wall dividing the main bar and dance floor. Now the setup is basically a bar on one side and dining on the other.</p>

<p>Rachel wasn&rsquo;t really feeling pizza so I ordered one up for myself. I got a fourteen incher with pepperoni and black olives on it along with a cold PBR draft. The pizza came out hot an ready to eat. The cheese was covering the curst all the way to the edges. the medium-depth crust fit with the toppings. I was really hungry and maybe it was timing but I ended up driving in about half of it. It wasn&rsquo;t the best in the world but at the time tasted great.</p>

<p> Although I would love to try it again Jac&rsquo;s its on the other side of town from where I live so I won&rsquo;t be going there any time soon. If you are in the area I would suggest checking it out. If you&rsquo;re not really in the mood for pizza they have a bunch of other options. I wouldn&rsquo;t call the service the best I had but the place is new and it was slow. That&rsquo;s never a good combination but I&rsquo;m sure it will get better with time. They did have ledge above the urinals in the men&rsquo;s bathroom that I&rsquo;m sure I have seen in other places before but don&rsquo;t remember and at the time it was complete genius.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
