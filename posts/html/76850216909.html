                    <p>I had big plans this past weekend. I originally was supposed to go to Chicago on Sunday to see the band Good Riddance play with my pal Steve.  Being that it was a Sunday show out of town I took the following day off of work. Needless to say I didn&rsquo;t plan very well. And when it came down to it, I decided not to go. So there I was with a Monday off with really nothing to do. </p>

<p>I am rarely in Muskegon on a weekday let alone a Monday. I figured this would be a good time to hit up a lunch buffet that I read about in the coupon book. I had my son with me all day so I didn&rsquo;t want to get too crazy on picking a place eat. My first thought would be just to hit up the Pizza Hut. I think they still offer a buffet during lunch hours. I took another look through the coupon book and ultimately decided on Booyahs!. There was a coupon for a lunch buffet for $4.99. I figured we can&rsquo;t really beat that so off we went.</p>

<p>The only other time I&rsquo;d been to <a href="http://www.booyahssportsbar.com/">Booyahs!</a> was this past summer grabbing a beer with some friends. Its basically a sports bar tucked away in a strip mall on the outskirts of the mall area. I really like the place. They have a great beer selection and according to the place mat at the table they have a food special pretty much every night of the week. </p>

<p>On this particular day we pretty much had the place to ourselves. I&rsquo;m not sure if that was because it was a Monday or what. Regardless it was kind of nice. They offered $2 bottles of locally brewed beer which was totally awesome. I gave the waitress my coupon, ordered a Centennial IPA and headed up to the buffet area. They offered salad (which had its own little area), pizza, pasta, and chicken wings dunked in sweet and sour sauce (which had a clever name that escapes me at the moment). I grabbed a salad along with a little pasta and headed back to eat.</p>

<p>The salad was alright. I chose ranch for the dressing which was pretty good. I added a little cheese and bacon for flavor, so I couldn&rsquo;t really go wrong there. The pasta I chose this round was made with Italian dressing. Pretty typical pasta salad. I headed back up to get some pizza. They had two out at the time, one pepperoni and one that looked like a deluxe. I grabbed a slice of the deluxe, a couple pepperoni, a couple bread sticks and one wing.</p>

<p>The pizza itself was pretty mediocre. It had a real fluffy crust, not much sauce at all and the cheese tasted like it had bee sitting out a while. Again, being a buffet, they slices were cut really small and took at bit from the taste I thought. The bread sticks weren&rsquo;t bad but there was no extra marinara to dip them in which was a little disappointing. In the end I headed back up for a couple slices and called it a day.</p>

<p>It was a good thing I had a coupon for this place and that they had a tremendous deal on craft beers otherwise I would have been really disappointed. I really want to go back to <a href="http://www.booyahssportsbar.com/">Booyahs!</a> (despite they goofy name) to try some of they other food they offer. It&rsquo;s not that far from my current residence and would love to catch a wings game there. Hopefully I can make that happen a couple of times this season.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 2 slices</p>
