                    <p>A lot can happen in fours and well, little can also happen in four years. That&rsquo;s not to say I live a boring life or anything, it&rsquo;s just that life goes fast and before you know it you look back and realize how little you&rsquo;ve accomplished. That&rsquo;s life though, right? Another thing to note is that I have officially been married for four years. So Ray and I decided to hit up a &ldquo;higher-end&rdquo; joint to celebrate the occasion.</p>

<p>We decided on <a href="http://www.bravokalamazoo.com/">Bravo!</a>. I&rsquo;ve never been to this place before, only have heard that they have a bomb ass brunch on Sundays. They also have a wood-burning pizza oven that cooks &ldquo;Tuscan-style&rdquo; individual pies that come in all kids of combinations. The sweet Italian was very tempting as was the chicken Gorgonzola. But I have to keep it consistent, and real, so I went with a pepperoni and black olive. </p>

<p>The one thing that stuck out to me on this pizza was the crust. It was a good and cooked covered in some sort of olive oil I think? Regardless, it was fantastic. The peperoni and black olive was a great comb to go along with the crust. The sauce was a bit on the sweet side that wasn&rsquo;t a bad addition at all. I housed in all but two slices. I finished the meal off with a whiskey dessert. On the rocks because I didn&rsquo;t know what my other option was. I have a lot to learn when it comes to fine dining.</p>

<p>Another surprise for the evening was that they had their own craft beer selection. I tried the Pale Ale and the American I.P.A. and was impressed by both. If you don&rsquo;t like beer they have a hell of a selection of wine. I also heard a  They also offer cooking classes in the back of the restaurant to anyone who wants to sign up. When we got up to leave I heard a commotion in back. Apparently they also hold cooking classes on certain night of the week.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
