                    <p>This was an an interesting week. After getting back from Colorado, I was quickly back out of town again between playing rock shows and hanging with my Dad on Father&rsquo;s day. After a fast weekend I didn&rsquo;t do any grocery shopping and/or prepping for lunch during the week. So after eating out like every day I figure I&rsquo;d pick a day for pizza. I have a list of pizza places to visit around my office for days like these. Especially joints that sell it by the slice. I recall one down Division a few miles so off I went&hellip;.<a href="http://www.carlospizzaconnection.com/">Carlo&rsquo;s Pizza Connection</a> my destination.</p>

<p>Now here is where the fun part of this comes in. I really had no idea what I was getting myself into as far as this place was concerned. When I rolled up I saw a few construction workers taking down some slices so I was immediately excited. I had to passed through a beaded curtain and walked up to the counter. It was simple in there. A counter, drink cooler and a sign of what they had to offer. I opted for a slice of pepperoni and meat lovers Chicago Style.</p>

<p>Now this is where a little confusion sets in for me. I saw the guy reach in to the oven grab a couple of slices, box them up and send me on my way. In the back up my mind I keep thinking about this so-called Chicago Style. It certainly wasn&rsquo;t the Chicago style I am accustom to.</p>

<p>Once I got back to my office I immediately did some research. It turns out (and I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve never thought to look this up before) that all Chicago style really is is sauce and topping covered with cheese. That&rsquo;s it in its simplest form. Now, there are variations but that&rsquo;s it. I don&rsquo;t know, I guess I was disappointed to find out that Chicago style can vary so much it&rsquo;s basically may as we be eating New York. Oh well, I popped the box open and dug in. Man was I presently surprised.</p>

<p>I guess I wasn&rsquo;t paying much attention when the guy at the counter was boxing up my food. The size of the slices seemed enormous. Cheesy&hellip;greasy&hellip;it was all there. With the crust buttered up the taste just exploded in my mouth. I seriously considered getting three slices because they were so cheap, there would be no way I could have driven all of it in.</p>

<p>Again, sometime you are pleasantly surprised at not only what is in your backyard but how far a few bucks can go these days. At $1.50 a slice I can guarantee this place is going to have a repeat customer. I ended walking out of the place with two slices and a can of pop for under $5. Sometimes nothing beats a good old-fashioned slice.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
