                                    <h1>The Icehouse by Old Burdick's</h1>
                    <p>I started playing hockey this past fall for the first time in a few years. I love the game but boy I can tell it&rsquo;s been way too long since I&rsquo;ve laced them up. It&rsquo;s nearing the end of the season and we just clinched the semi finals to get a spot in the finals next week. In the league I play in if you win, your teams get two free pizzas on the house.</p>

<p>I play at Wings Stadium and a couple of years ago they revamped the upstairs area and added a bar. I don&rsquo;t know what it was originally but now it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.oldburdicks.com/">Burdick&rsquo;s</a>. The Icehouse by Burdick&rsquo;s to be exact. This is like no other Burdick&rsquo;s in that the staff is pretty slack and all of the players complain about it. Honestly though it makes the post game hangout interesting. </p><p>This particular night we ordered one pepperoni and one sausage after our victory. Apparently half way through the season the staff started thawing out the crust earlier in the day to give more rise to the crust. I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s necessarily true because I didn&rsquo;t notice much but probably wouldn&rsquo;t anyway. Regardless free pizza is always better and after busting your ass on the ice for an hour it really hits the spot. This may be a different story if I would have had it any other time.</p>

<p>All in all the pizza is pretty good. I wouldn&rsquo;t suggest the sausage but I&rsquo;m not a fan of sausage in any form and certainly not on my pizza. We have had bacon and ham once, but that was a little over whelming. I realize no one ever goes to Burdick&rsquo;s to eat pizza but if you ever do stick with the pepperoni and tell them to leave it in there an extra minute or two.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
