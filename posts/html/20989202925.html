                                    <h1>The Chuck Wagon</h1>
                    <p>Round two of my Ludington hockey pizza excursion. My team did not end up making it to the finals of the tournament. Which was probably alright by most of us anyway. The post-game Mickey&rsquo;s just added to the relaxation that was about to occur that evening. I&rsquo;m not used to playing two hockey games in one day and I was ready for a break. </p>

<p>Now that rub and tubs barbecue was out for an option for dinner, we talked about hitting this place called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Chuck-Wagon/160482828831">The Chuck Wagon</a> up. I was feeling pretty good after a soak in the hot tub along with a few more post-game beers and was ready to eat. This place was kind off outside of the main town. Ludington is fairly small so even though it was off the beaten path it didn&rsquo;t take long to get there. Although once there, it kind of seemed like it was in the middle of nowhere. One of the first things I noticed about the restaurant was how small it was. We had a group of about eight or nine and it seemed like we were taking up the entire place. I&rsquo;m sure that was just me though. Jason, Jeff and I ordered up a large pie with pepperoni and mushrooms. Apparently this place is somewhat synonymous for the amount of toppings they put on their pies so I was out ruled with just pepperoni. We also ordered a pitcher of Bass and waited patiently while the pizzas cooked. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how, but some time during the ordering process Jeff snuck in a appetizer order of these parmesan bread sticks things. They were pretty good, but not as good as they looked. It was sort of a crusted bread with cheese baked into the middle. I think I was more concerned about getting my drink on at this point or eating the actual pizza because I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to these things. They were a good warm up but I was ready for the main dish.</p>

<p>Finally the pizza came out. The crust thickness was right in the middle somewhere. Much thicker than Sportsman&rsquo;s and no where near Chicago-style. It was well-cooked and the pepperoni and mushrooms were piled on high. I&rsquo;m not really one for a ton of toppings in my pizza. I like one, maybe two. Anything after that your risking a sprained tongue. Somehow though, in ol&rsquo; Chuck Wagon&rsquo;s case, it seemed to work. And work well. I ended taking in a couple of slices. After that, a couple of beers and the break sticks to warm up with, I was definitely satisfied. I think there were a couple of slices left but we decided to take them with for a late night snack aback at the hotel room.</p>

<p>With the limited options available in Ludington during the non-tourist season, if you are ever there during this time, I highly suggest checking The Chuck Wagon out. Actually, screw that, check it out anyway. It&rsquo;s a quaint little place that where the people are nice and great food is served. The guy that runs (or maybe even owns) the place will most likely be there cooking the pies. I liked him so much I even bought a t-shirt. </p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
