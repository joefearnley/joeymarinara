                                    <h1>Jaspareâ€™s Buffet</h1>
                    <p>It was another Friday in the office and someone earlier in the week brought up <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Jaspares-Pizza-and-Fine-Italian-Food/190057067047">Jasper&rsquo;s</a> as a possible lunch outing open to anyone who wanted to go. They just opened a new location in the area and they offer a lunch buffet. For $7.50 you get a drink of choice and all the pizza, salad, and bread sticks you can eat. I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://joeymarinara.com/post/4284189557/jaspares-pizza">blogged about Jasper&rsquo;s before</a> and I remembered it being very good. I was sold and off we went.</p>

<p>The new place is pretty cool. I&rsquo;ve never been in any of their other locations before so I have nothing to compare it too but it was a typical pizza/Italian joint with lots of red, green, and white on everything. I ordered my spot on the buffet and was off to check things out. Unfortunately we must have showed up a little late for the lunch crowd as it was slim pickin&rsquo;s at the buffet by the time we got there. What was pretty cool was the kid working behind the counter (who happened to be another 80&rsquo;s-pizza-delivery type with bleached-blonde hair and all) came out and asked us what we wanted and he&rsquo;d go back and make it. Shortly there after the dude came out with a meat lovers, BBQ chicken and another stuffed pie. </p>

<p>The pizza had all the elements of a classic. Great crust, juicy meats, melted cheese, and a great tasting sauce. The bread sticks were made with some sort of seasoning and parmesan. They were like crack. I wish I could have had more but my stomach was putting it&rsquo;s foot down and I still had to go back to work for the afternoon and try not to fall asleep. Turns out they never refilled the salad bar while I was there but it really didn&rsquo;t matter, it would have just got in the way.</p>

<p>All in all, the Jaspare&rsquo;s buffet experience was a pleasant one. When I do go again, I would like to try the calzone there. One of the my co-workers ordered one and the thing was the size of a football and looked delicious. Options are limited in Three Rivers so I am sure I&rsquo;ll be back.</p>
