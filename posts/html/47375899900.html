                    <p>I gave this diet a good run for two months. Once you lose a little weight you tend to relax a little bit. At least I do. Especially with Spring around the corner. Regardless I took this week off and I figured I should hit up a pizza joint for lunch. Get while the gettin’ is good.</p>

<p>I looked at my list of pizza places and one that stuck out to me was <a href="http://www.pjspizzashop.com/">PJ’s</a>. I’m not sure why. I think at one point I got this confused with <a href="http://joeymarinara.com/post/20989366539/jbs-pizza-parlor">JB’s</a> (if not mistaken I think there is even a BJ’s in the area). It’s all so confusing. I also noticed the place seemed to be a little bit of a hike. I had time and was hungry so I decided to make the trek. East Kenwood here I come.</p>

<p>PJ’s is located in a strip mall near the end of 52nd St. in Kentwood. I don’t get out to this much and from what I can tell is mainly made up of subdivisions and a few office buildings here and there. I suppose that is the majority of greater Grand Rapids but everything around this area seemed to be newer looking. </p>

<p>After driving for about 12 minutes I arrived at PJ’s. As I walked in I was immediately greeted by a girl behind the counter. Next to her was a rotisserie heater thing with three pizzas in it. She informed me of the lunch special which was 2 slices of pizza and a pop for $3.50 (I think. It was close to that anyway). The other option was a slice and a breadstick with a pop for the same price. I opted with the 2 slices and added a slice of ham on top of that. The total was around $4.50. I headed out to my car and back to the office to dig in.</p>

<p>When I got back to the office I started with one of the pepperoni slices. It was the typical pizza-by-the-slice with cheese, average sauce and crispy pepperoni. It tasted a bit like it had been under the heat lamp a little too long. That&rsquo;s the risk you take though. The ham, on the other hand, tasted fresh. The cheese had the right consistency and chewy crust to go a long with it.</p>

<p>If I lived or worked near PJ’s I would probably become a regular. A solid meal for under $5 is starting to become rare these days. Unfortunately there are too many places like this that offer something similar around my parts so driving 10-15 minutes for it is not worth it. And like most of these type of joints they offer salads and sandwiches. I can’t speak for these but looking at the options I was tempted. Maybe I can save this for a meal in the future. Probably not, but I suppose it’s worth mentioning. Had the timing been better, I probably would have enjoyed the pepperoni a little better. If you do hit PJ&rsquo;s up for lunch, do a once over on the heat lamp to see what you are working with.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
