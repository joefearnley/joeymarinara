                                    <h1>Papa Pete's</h1>
                    <p>I didn&rsquo;t have hockey this past weekend. Not to say that I don&rsquo;t miss it and should be picking up an extra sticks and pucks to stay on top of my game but sometimes you just need a day to relax. Especially with a new little one hanging around. I knew that my weekend would be somewhat uneventful going into it and planned to have pizza at least one night. Sunday rolled around, I had leaves to bag and I still didn&rsquo;t have any pizza.</p>

<p>This was also the day we decided to hit up a restaurant as a family. Rachel and I are used to eating out five nights a week so this past month and a half have been a little interesting as far as the dinner thing goes. Learning to cook is one thing but the ease of eating is a completely other level. We hit up Burdicks earlier in the day and it didn&rsquo;t really go that well. Later in the day, after a couple of beers, leaf bagging and no pizza, I started to look at my options. I had only heard good things about <a href="http://www.papapete.net/">Papa Pete&rsquo;s</a> pizza and that they have a killer deal on Sunday take out pies, so I called them up.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if the guy on the phone and I were on the same page but I was trying to figure out what my choices were for pizza. I tried to get an idea of what the price may be but after some runaround and a few questions, I decided on two mediums pies, $6.50 a piece. Dave was at the house so we decided to head down there and grab a couple of beers while they cooked. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.papapete.net/">Papa Pete&rsquo;s</a> is an interesting place. It&rsquo;s located in downtown Kalamazoo and is connected to a greek restaurant named The Blue Dolphin. I&rsquo;ve never been to The Blue Dolphin but have been to Papa Pete&rsquo;s plenty of times. Most of which were to see a band or two play and on a couple of occasions just to hang out and shoot a little pool or play foosball. There was weird vibe there that night. It was a Sunday and was like soul night or something with a DJ. Regardless, we finished up the beers, grabbed the pies and headed home.</p>

<p>Once back at the house we opened the first pizza up. It looked and smelled great. I grabbed a couple of slices and headed to the living room. It had a thinner crust and was very cheesy. The sauce was no slouch itself adding a great mix of tomato and spices to round out a great pizza. The cheese and pepperoni was melted perfectly together. I think I ended up taking down almost half a pie in a sitting. It was very addicting.</p>

<p>If I had to suggest checking out a cheap pizza joint on a Sunday, I would definitely suggest Papa Pete&rsquo;s. Although I&rsquo;ve been there a bunch of times, I don&rsquo;t think I ever ate the food there. Rachel and I have a hard time decided what should be on the menu for the evening. This just might turn into a regular thing for us.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
