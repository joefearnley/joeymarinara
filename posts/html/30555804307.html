                    <p>I love me some good old Northern Michigan especially in the middle of the summer. Adam&rsquo;s parents own a cabin on the great lake of and little town named Bear Lake. Bear Lake, to me, is like the hidden gem of Northern Michigan. I&rsquo;ve passed through the it many times on my way up to places like Traverse City being that US-31 runs right through it. Unfortunately it is so small that if you blink you can miss it. </p>

<p>The Cox&rsquo;s were gracious enough to let us use it this past weekend as long as we didn&rsquo;t piss off the neighbors. Apparently people like to &ldquo;get away&rdquo; and relax while they are up there. They don&rsquo;t like to be bother by young people looking to get loose. We held back as much as we could and I think we did a pretty good job.</p>

<p>Due to some traffic issues and other setbacks, Rachel and I didn&rsquo;t get up there until Friday evening. It was kind of too late for a worthwhile boat cruise and the weather wasn&rsquo;t exactly cooperating so we decided to go out for dinner. That and I figured I would be at Saddle Up! about 8 more times throughout the weekend so why do now? So we headed in to town, past the variety store, the Trading-Post-turned-surf-shop, Bear Lake bar and after little deliberation continued down the 31 to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Rosies-Place/114848515201043">Rosie&rsquo;s</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Rosies-Place/114848515201043">Rosie&rsquo;s</a> is a roadside bar and grille just south of Bear Lake and probably one of the only thing between it and Manistee along the highway. I wouldn&rsquo;t call the place that unique, it&rsquo;s basically a dive bar that hasn&rsquo;t change much in the 30 years (including the trough urinal they have in the mens room) but that is what gives it a little character. A couple of years ago we were up there and saw an advertisement for mud wrestling in one of the upcoming weekends. I was hoping for some entertainment like that but all that was there were a couple of families (who I am pretty sure we&rsquo;re not digging me or my over-sized Telorez t-shirt) and a salad bar they were closing up. </p>

<p>We ordered up some pitchers, an appetizer platter and a couple of pizzas. One pepperoni and one pepperoni and sausage. I don&rsquo;t remember the exact reasoning for ordering these particular toppings only that I was hungry and ready to eat so I dug in.</p>

<p>As for the pizza, the one thing that stuck out to me was the crust. It was abnormally crisp for this type of pizza. To me that made it pretty good. As for the other ingredients they were pretty mediocre. I mean, in a place that basically serves bar food and you&rsquo;ve had a few cocktails pizza is pretty much pizza. I finished off a few slices after a couple of chicken wings and was quite satisfied.</p>

<p>Our night ended with a trip back through town and pit stop at the Bear Lake Bar for some more local color (and/or talent). I don&rsquo;t think they liked our choice of music but maybe that&rsquo;s because there was only one speaker and no one offering cross-cuts. But honestly, if you are ever on your way through the Bear Lake area of Michigan I&rsquo;d suggest stopping off at Rosie&rsquo;s not necessarily for the pizza but just for the atmosphere. Depending on the time of day you visit you are sure to meet some characters. I&rsquo;d also suggest checking out the variety store in town, you can get a hell of deal on sunglasses.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
