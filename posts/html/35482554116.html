                                    <h1>Metro Diner</h1>
                    <p>I had a chance to hit the town for bit recently in Kalamazoo and was checking out my options. Earlier in the month I saw that Mustard Plug was playing in town that night with some other ska band from Chicago opening along with Chad&rsquo;s soul group. The last few times in town they have played at <a href="http://joeymarinara.com/post/7785392905/the-strutt">The Strutt</a> which is gone now and I thought I remember reading that it was at Louie&rsquo;s which is always a good time. Upon further investigation I saw that the show had been changed to <a href="http://www.the411club.com/">the 411 Club</a>. I had no idea where this place was but soon realized it was in the same building as <a href="http://www.the411club.com/nightclub/">The Metro</a>. I waited until the right time and headed toward downtown. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;d actually been to The Metro a couple of times before and had no idea that the area where the 411 club even existed. I mean it would&rsquo;ve had to. It didn&rsquo;t look like a this area was new at all. Regardless, having been here before I remember there was a diner area in the back that I always wanted to check out. It seems this has since moved into it&rsquo;s own area but you can order food anywhere in the building from it.</p>

<p>When I walked in the club Chad&rsquo;s band was playing and I immediately ran into some people I knew and they invited me to the booth they were sitting in. They informed me that they special tonight was $1 Old Style cans so I ordered a few of them up. After a while the band had finished up and a pizza was delivered to the table. I wasn&rsquo;t necessarily hungry but they offered my a slice. I initially declined the offer but after catching a smell of the pie I decided to take a slice.</p>

<p>The pizza itself was pretty good. It had a thin crust and a lot of cheese. I didn&rsquo;t order the pizza so I wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure what was on it. Maybe pepperoni and some sort of sausage? Things got a little fuzzy after a few Old Styles and even though I took a picture it is still hard to tell. I know that after eating dinner earlier and having only one slice I certainly could have gone for more. That has to say something.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say that pizza would be the first thing I would order from Metro Diner. Unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t see a menu while I was there so I can&rsquo;t say if anything else there sounded appealing. I can say that the venue was pretty cool and it is always good to have more of those around town. As more close down a few tend to pop up. Let&rsquo;s hope we can eventually balance things out.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
