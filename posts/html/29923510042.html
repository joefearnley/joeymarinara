                    <p>It&rsquo;s lunchtime and I forgot my prepack at home. I have two options at this point. I can resort to a default fast food or sandwich joint or I can hit what I know call the &ldquo;pizza sheet&rdquo; to see if there are any places that may be quick. According to Google there is a place called <a href="http://liaspizza.net/">Lia&rsquo;s</a> off 44th that sells slices at lunch time so I made my way over to check things out.</p>

<p>Like most of the mom and pop pizza joints around the area, the inside was rather small. A couple of tables, a pop machine and the counter where you order. They had the rotating warmer next to the counter loaded with available for self service. One thing that stood out to me was the two people working behind the counter which I assume were the owners talking Italian back to each other. They literally were the mom and pop of this place. There was also a piece of paper advertising a new dish which was some sort of filled Sicilian-style dough ball. I don&rsquo;t recall what was in the middle but it sounded interesting. Maybe next time I&rsquo;ll pick a couple up. I grabbed two pepperoni slices out of the warmer, paid for them at the counter and headed outside to eat.</p>

<p> Unfortunately before stepping outside I accidentally put some garlic salt on my slices. For some reason I must have thought it was parmesan cheese. I was talking with the lady behind the counter about a to-go menu at the time so that might have messed things up for me. Obviously I struggle at doing two things at once.</p>

</p><p>The pizza itself was pretty par. Adding some garlic salt to the mix didn&rsquo;t seem to help things either. I was hot, it was hot, and I don&rsquo;t think that helped things. Being outside in 90-degree weather doesn&rsquo;t make eating hot pizza a very good experience. A little dissatisfied, I drove in the two slices in quickly and headed to my car to turn on the air conditioner. I didn&rsquo;t want this experience to last any longer that it needed to.</p>

<p>With so many of these types of restaurants in the area I have no idea how any of these places survive. I suppose most of them have been around for a long time so they must have some pretty loyal customers. They also seem to offer other things on the menu like burritos and burgers so that must have an appeal. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d go back to Lia&rsquo;s for pizza. Maybe for the dough balls though, those sounded interesting.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
