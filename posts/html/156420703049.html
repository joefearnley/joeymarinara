                    <p>The bachelor party didn’t stop at the Grand Rapids Brewing Company. After a pit stop at The Pyramid Scheme, a quick stop in a random parking garage, a comedy show featuring the great Joey Diaz, a fruity drink at T.G.I. Friday’s, and a stop at the local gentleman’s club, we all made it back to the our hotel in one piece. Well, at least those who I ended up with.</p>

<p>We stopped in to the hotel bar for last call and someone got the idea to order pizza. It turns out the go to late-night pizza spot for this area is none other than <a href="http://www.mrpizzagr.com/" target="_blank">Mr. Pizza</a>. I ordered up a couple of pepperoni pies as we finished our drinks then headed back to the hotel room to wait for the delivery.</p>

<p>The pizza arrived shortly after and we dug right in. I have to be honest; things were pretty vague at this point in the night. Actually I am surprised I actually remembered to score some pictures of the pizza at all. I do remember it being pretty good and that it did not take long for a group of dudes to take down two large pizzas in a short amount of time. Unfortunately, the pictures don’t really do it justice.</p>

<p>This was my first experience with <a href="http://www.mrpizzagr.com/" target="_blank">Mr. Pizza</a>. I actually had a chance to eat it before but fell asleep at a buddy’s house before it arrived and it was all gone by the time I woke up. The total was around $20 for two, one-topping pizzas, which is kind of the sweet spot for pizza delivered from a mom and pop shop. I wouldn’t seek out Mr. Pizza in the middle of the day with the plethora of option in Grand Rapids but at 2 in the morning, you can’t really go wrong.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
