                                    <h1>Papa Romano’s</h1>
                    <p>A month or so ago my team at work had the responsibility of putting together a community event where we were in and out of the office all week doing a number of things to get ready for it. These types of things can be fun. They tend to break the day up a little bit and it’s always nice to have a little change from your normal day to day schedule. On Friday we were exceptionally busy so my boss decided to buy us pizza for lunch. When asked what I like on my pizza I said pepperoni and hoped for the best.</p>

<p>Whoever decided to order the pizza ended up going with <a href="http://paparomanos.com/">Papa Romano’s</a>.  This place has been on my radar for a while because it is not far from my office and after driving by it one day noticed they offer slices for lunch. They are also a chain which, from what I can tell, most of its locations are in the Detroit area.</p>

<p>The pizza arrived shortly after the order was put in. We have some vegetarians on my team so they ordered one pepperoni and one green and black olive. They were made with a deep dish style crust which seems to be crust of choice for most customers.</p>

<p>I took a slice of each and dug in. Being a deep dish style crust, there was a lot of fluff to it. The bottom and sides of the crust had plenty of oil on them and had a nice crunch when you bit into them. It also had a nice layer of cheese that when combined with the crispy pepperoni and greasy crust had some great flavor. The olive slice was an interesting one. I love olives and have had both black and green on my pizza before but never together. It added a lot of salty flavor which I really liked.</p>

<p>Although it is a chain <a href="http://paparomanos.com/">Papa Romano’s</a> offers a pretty good slice of pizza. If I had to compare to anything, it would definitely be Jet’s as there were a lot of similarities between the two. <a href="http://paparomanos.com/">Papa Romano’s</a> also offers salads, subs, and sides if you are not in the mood for pizza. Odds are though, if you are not in Holland, you’ll most likely have to go to Detroit if you want some of this pizza.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
