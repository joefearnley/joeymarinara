                    <p>The chit chat during the warm ups of an adult hockey league game can be interesting sometimes. It&rsquo;s usually along the lines of &ldquo;How&rsquo;s it going?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What&rsquo;d you get into last night?&rdquo;, &ldquo;How&rsquo;s your mom?&rdquo;. During this past hockey season a guy asked me if I had tried this place called <a href="http://rocketspizzamuskegon.com/">Rocket&rsquo;s Pizza</a>. Pizza talk before a game&hellip;thatâ€™s a new one.</p>

<p>I told him I&rsquo;d actually not even heard of the place and I&rsquo;ll have to check it out. A few days later, I recalled the conversation and decided to look the place up. It was only about 10 minutes from me and I had no lunch so I decided to check it out.</p>

<p>Rocket&rsquo;s Pizza is located in North Muskegon, MI in tiny, strip mall next to the Whippi Dip there. It&rsquo;s a small, cozy place with a surprising amount of seating. In addition to pizza, they offer subs, appetizers, and even full on dinners like ribs, chicken, and lasagna. They had the rack warmer with a couple of pies going next to the cash register. They offered a lunch deal - two slices and a fountain drink for $3.50. I went for the deal and got two slices of pepperoni. I then grabbed my cup, filled it up with some Diet Coke, and found a seat.</p>

<p>Sometimes you can get screwed on the slice deal and they cut them really small. In this case, the slices were pretty good size and were pretty fresh. The crust was nice and crispy. The pepperoni was a bit crispy as well on one of the slices, giving a bit of that burnt taste. I ate both slices pretty fast leaving me hungry for more. I slammed my soda and got out of there before I bought any more. In the end, I was pretty satisfied.</p>

<p>Being that this place is so far from my house, I&rsquo;ll probably never order an entire pizza from Rocket&rsquo;s. Which is unfortunate because they have a specialty pizza called the Spicy Pig that sounds amazing (I&rsquo;m a sucker for anything capicola). Maybe next time I&rsquo;m in for lunch they will have some slices available for that. They also have an Italian sub that looks tasty. I might just try that next time.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
