                                    <h1>Stromboli’s</h1>
                    <p>In my continuing quest to visit every place pizza place around my work office, I attempted to try a different one. After taking a different way into work the other day and noticed a place name <a href="http://strombolisholland.com/">Stromboli’s</a>. I first tried to swing in there for lunch a couple of weeks ago but at this point in the year, they only offer lunch on Thursdays and Fridays. Being a Tuesday I was out of luck. So last Friday I had some errands to run and swung in there during do so.</p>

<p><a href="http://strombolisholland.com/">Stromboli’s</a> is located in a building just off of the highway that it shares with another business. The inside is pretty simple. There is a counter to order/pick up the food, a cooler with soda in it, the kitchen, and a bathroom. They offer pizza, subs, salads, and more. On Thursdays and Fridays they have a $5 lunch special that I was interested in checking out.</p>

<p>There was only one employee working at the time that seemed pretty frazzled. She explained to me what the lunch specials were all about. Some of them included 2 slices of pizza, a 10 inch pizza, stromboli, and half a sub with chips. According to the employee it had been pretty busy since they opened that she hadn’t had time to make a pizza to sell for slices. They were also out of chips for the sub deal. So I opted for the 10 inch pizza with pepperoni.</p>

<p>She had to make the pizza and said it would take about 10 minutes. I paid for the meal and patiently waited for the pizza to cook. After about 6 minutes the pizza was done and the woman boxed it up. Since there was no seating at the location and I hadn’t run my errands yet, I decided to drive to where I needed to go and just eat in the car. I was really hungry at this point and opened up the box as soon as I got to my destination. After trying to eat a slice I realized the pizza was still really hot so I decided to run into the store and wait to eat until I got back to the office.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed about the pizza was that they put the cheese over the toppings which I have no preference of. After the first two bites I realized how soft the crust was. It was also thin you had to get a solid grip on the slice to get a good bite. The sauce was sweet and pepperoni slices were the larger ones covering more ground on the pie. By far the best part was the cheese. It was greasy, gooey, and plentiful. It basically melted in my mouth. About half way through the pie I realized how big a 10 inch of this kind was. In lieu of not having to fight the urge to take a nap at my desk in the afternoon I ate one more slice and saved the rest for dinner.</p>

<p>In the end I was surprised how much food I got for $5. I could have easily split this with someone for a solid lunch. I rarely got to places like this for subs, but I’d also like to check those out sometime. They had an Italian option that looked great. If find yourself on the east side of Holland and are looking for a bite I would suggest checking out <a href="http://strombolisholland.com/">Stromboli’s</a>.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
