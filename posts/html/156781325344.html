                    <p>The beginning of the year means many things. To me, some of these include setting up new goals for the year, trying powering through the remainder of winter weather with out becoming completely depressed, and going to the dentist for my bi-yearly checkup. On a fine January mourning last week, I had a cleaning sometime around 11am that got done around noon.</p>

<p>I didn’t bring any lunch with me so I had a couple of options. I could go back home and grab something or hit some place on my way to the office. First thing was first, I had to fill the car up with some gas. I stopped at the <a href="https://www.speedway.com/" target="_blank">Speedway</a> just down the road from the dentist office. As I pumped the gas I pondered the options inside <a href="https://www.speedway.com/" target="_blank">Speedway</a> for lunch. The have food options they offered were cheap and fast that worked in a pinch. Perfect.</p>

<p>I frequent this particular <a href="https://www.speedway.com/" target="_blank">Speedway</a> often because it is on my way to work, just off the highway, at about the midpoint of my commute. The place is always busy and at noon on a Wednesday was no exception. They offer nachos, hotdogs of all shapes and sizes, sandwiches, these taquito looking things called Tornado’s, and of course, pizza.</p>

<p>For slices of pizza, they have a 2 for $3 deal going all the time. After no deliberation at all, my decision was made and I opened the warmers and took out a couple slices of the pepperoni pizza. They had a couple of options for toppings including a garlic salt and parmesan cheese. I gave each slice a good sprinkler of each, paid my money, and went on my way.</p>

<p>I headed for the office and dug into the pizza. The first thing I noticed was the crust was a little thick It was like the bottom part of it was really crispy but the dough was still very soft. The cheese was pretty much fried off where it actually did exist, most likely from sitting in the warmer for a couple of hours, so there was not much there to add any flavor. The pepperoni was also very cooked but not quite crispy yet very chewy. The sauce didn’t have much flavor which I was hoping would save this slice of pizza but unfortunately did not.</p>

<p>If I had to compare the pizza to anything else it would be a middle of the road frozen pizza you would find at the store. I know you can’t expect much from food at a gas station, but I was hoping for a little more. Years back I got into a kick where I was eating <a href="https://www.speedway.com/" target="_blank">Speedway</a> breakfast sandwiches (because of course, the 2 for $3 deal) but that didn’t last long. Even though the food is fast and cheap, if you are in a hurry, take the extra few minutes and dollars and hit up a McDonald’s or Burger King, you will be much better off.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 2 slices</p>
