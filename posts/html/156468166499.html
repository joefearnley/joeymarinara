                                    <h1>Magic Stick</h1>
                    <p>I went to another rock show this past weekend and this time it was to see the band Lagwagon. They released a banger of an album earlier in the year and are out on tour with the Swingin’ Utters.  A couple of buddies and I hit the road to catch the show in Detroit. We headed out a little early in the day to do a little sightseeing before the show.</p>

<p>We got a room at the Marriott Courtyard in downtown Detroit. Once settled I there we talked about what the next steps were. Jason was dead set on hitting up this place called <a href="http://www.sweetwatertavern.net/" target="_blank">Sweetwater Tavern</a> for lunch which was a block away.  The place is <a href="http://www.sweetwatertavern.net/about-sweetwater.html" target="blank">about as old as Detroit</a> and are known for their chicken wings.</p>

<p>Sweetwater Tavern was a really cool place. The building is over 100 years old and has a lot of character. I ordered the wings which were excellent. You only have one option for sauce which I liked. I love chicken wings and these things lived up to the hype. I highly suggest stopping by this place on before a ball game if you have the chance.</p>

<p>After hitting <a href="http://www.jacobysbar.com/" target="_blank">Jacoby’s</a> for a few and regrouping back at the hotel, we called for a cab to bring us to the venue. The show was at a place called The Magic Stick which is located on the outskirts of downtown near the downtown campus of Wayne State in what is called Midtown. It is located above a bowling alley next door to The Majestic Theater.</p>

<p>The last time I was here the area was pretty sketchy; to the point where I was very particular about where I was going to park. Since then the area has built up to be a pretty nice area filled with a plethora of restaurants, bars and coffee shops. You gotta love gentrification.</p>

<p>We finally got to the venue and a while later the show started. This Legend was the first band to play and they weren’t half bad (their line up contained the old guitar player and drummer from Yellowcard, which was interesting). Next up were Swingin’ Utters who I never really got into but put on a pretty good show.</p>

<p>While waiting for Lagwagon to place, Jason and I posted up at a high table near the bar. Shortly thereafter Justin came out of nowhere with a few slices of pizza. Talk about timing. After hours of drinking this slice of pizza was like heaven. It was warm, doughy, and cheesy. The perfect companion to the tall Labatt Blue I was drinking.</p>

<p>Lagwagon finally played and was great as always. I even got to say hi to The Caper.  I wouldn’t seek out the Magic Stick for pizza specifically but if you can see a show there, take advantage. It is a cool place in a up and coming part of town. Worst case scenario you can always go bowling.</p>

<p>Here are a few shots from the show:</p>
