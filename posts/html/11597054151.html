                                    <h1>Bilbo's Pan</h1>
                    <p>Well after one hell of a weekend I was already in the mood for pizza again. Dave brought up the idea of hitting up <a href="http://bilbospizza.com/">Bilbo&rsquo;s</a> again as they have a special on Tuesday&rsquo;s (or is it Monday&rsquo;s? Doesn&rsquo;t matter). It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;The Family Special&rdquo; where you get a large pizza &hellip;&hellip; I &rsquo;ve wanted to check their pan pizza for a while as all I ever get when I go is the stuffed pie. We finalized the plans and headed on over. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://joeymarinara.com/post/4379752246/bilbos">complained about the service before</a> at Bilbo&rsquo;s and tonight seemed a little better. It seemed everyone at the table was a little worn out from the weekend reminiscing about how things got a little loose. We ordered a couple of beers and the family special while continuing on our conversation.</p>

<p>The pizza came out nice and hot. I would say there was anything special about it other than if you like thick, pan style you would enjoy this. The crust was a little too doughy for me but the cheese and sauce evened things out. After two slices and a couple of beers my stomach was becoming full. I added another half slice and threw in the towel.</p>

</p>

<p>Being my second time reviewing Bilbo&rsquo;s I do have to say the service was better. As for the pizza I plan to stick to the stuffed pie and do away with the break sticks. If there is one thing this world needs its another pan pizza. I know I&rsquo;ve certainly had better.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
