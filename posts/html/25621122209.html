                    <p>So&hellip;I&rsquo;m back. For those of you wondering, I&rsquo;ve been off the pizza for a while because I&rsquo;m trying to lose a little weight. Technically I get a cheat day but whenever those rolled around I ended up opting for something other than pizza beside I think for the one time I picked up a Hot &lsquo;n Ready one Saturday night and a couple of times after hockey. Well, I took a couple of weeks off of the diet and along with some spring cleaning I realized it&rsquo;s time to jump back into the game again.</p>

<p>One of the places on my list was <a href="http://www.genosgoldenpizza.com/">Geno&rsquo;s Golden Pizza</a>. I&rsquo;d really only heard of the place because there used to be a car parked on my street with the delivery sign on top. That and it&rsquo;s located in Parchment and I&rsquo;ve never actually been to Parchment even though it&rsquo;s only like 12 minutes from my house. I was out running errands so I ordered a large pepperoni, picked it about 15 minutes later and headed home to dig in.</p>

<p>Once home I popped open the box and went to town. It was still warm the remember the first couple of bites being fantastic. The cheese was golden like promised. The crust was surpisingly crispy on the outside. The crust was a bit on the thin side so if you are into that sort of thing I would suggest checking it out.</p>

<p>According to the woman working behind the counter Geno&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t really deliver to Kalamazoo&hellip;only for larger business-related orders. I personally wouldn&rsquo;t drive out to Parchment only for it just because there are so many places in Kalamazoo on the same level I would suggest first. I suppose though, if you are ever find yourself in Parchment with a hankering for pizza or just want to try something new at a good price I would certainly check out Geno&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
