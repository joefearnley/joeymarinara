                    <p>It&rsquo;s starting to feel like winter&rsquo;s never going to end around these parts. My mantra is usually all bets are off until the end of April (seriously it snowed the night I graduated college) but last year I think we got a little spoiled. One of the things I like about the weather getting warmer is getting outside and perusing downtown, maybe even hitting up a little outdoor dinner-eating action. This particular evening my pal Kurt was in town and asked me if I wanted to grab a drink. Unfortunately outdoors was not an options so we made plans to meet at <a href="http://joeymarinara.com/post/34911906543/old-peninsula-brew-pub">OP</a> a couple of hours after worked. </p>

<p>I didn’t really have any plans as far as dinner was concerned. I figured I would grab something when I was out as I didn’t know how long we were going to hang for. After a couple of beers at OP Ryan suggested we head over to <a href="http://www.zazios.com/">Zazio’s</a> and grab some dinner. At this point it was around 8 pm but I hadn’t eaten dinner (besides a few nachos that Kurt ordered) and I was already out so I said I figured why not. </p>

<p>I’ve always been hesitant to go to Zazio’s. Not that the food would be bad just that it was a little too high class for me. I guess I always figured why go here when you could go to Burdicks and get a burger and a beer. It&rsquo;s weird though. As much asI&rsquo;ve eaten out in the time that I&rsquo;ve lived in Kalamazoo I&rsquo;d never ate here. As we walked in they had the <a href="#%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.zazios.com/kalamazoo-home-page/chefs.html%E2%80%9D">chef’s table</a> in full force. I stared in somewhat amazement for a minute before we moved on to the lounge. Flames lit up behind a counter as a group of people clapped and cheered. This looked really cool as something to possibly add to the bucket list.</p>

<p>Apparently they offer some sort of deal on appetizers in the lounge on Thursday nights. I was pretty hungry at this point and really wanted more than an appetizer but really didn’t know what to expect. Turns out they offer a bunch of different types of pizzas. Upon reviewing the optons I didn’t exactly have a favorite but ended up going with the rosemary ham and mushroom. </p>

<p>The pizza came out a while after ordering. It was bigger than I anticipated it was going to be. The ham was piled high with the dry mushrooms sprinkled in. I don’t think I’ve ever had rosemary ham before. It was a lighter color almost that of turkey. You could certainly taste the rosemary in there somewhere. The crust was extremely thin and just crispy enough to where it almost tasted like a toasted sandwich. In the end I think I ate about ¾ of it while also eating a slice of the one Jamie ordered as well.</p>

<p>Zazio’s turned out really good for me. The only other time I had been there was to have a martini with some friends. Rachel used to go on a regular basis with friends from work but never seemed too impressed. I, for one, was left wanting more. The two things stood out on the bar menu for me were the beef sandwich and the meat/cheese board. All I know is that the next time we asks for restaurant options I’m suggesting Zazios.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
