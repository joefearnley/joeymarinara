                    <p>Fall is here and football season is upon us. Rachel got a craving for some BBQ chicken tenders from Brewster&rsquo;s so Dave and I decided to come along. Frankly I didn&rsquo;t even know this place even had pizza on the menu but they did and Dave talked me into it.</p>

<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t remember if there were options as far as the toppings were concerned but I ended up with pepperoni. The pizza itself was small, I&rsquo;d say 6 or 7 inches and was thin crust. Probably the only pizza in town in which I could eat the entire thing, I have to say it wasn&rsquo;t half bad. I&rsquo;m sure they got most of the ingredients from Gordon&rsquo;s or something but the combination of them, again, wasn&rsquo;t half bad.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say I would suggest Brewster&rsquo;s pizza to anyone until they change how they serve it. Being that there are a few of these around the area this may be the case one day. But for me on this Saturday afternoon when I couldn&rsquo;t decide on anything else on the menu it suited my needs just fine. </p>

<p>Final rating: 2 slices</p>
