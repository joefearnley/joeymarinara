                                    <h1>The Knickerbocker</h1>
                    <p>Last week was the great holiday, Cinco De Mayo. I always get this confused with Day of the Dead, but apparently it is a holiday to celebrate Mexico&rsquo;s victory in a war with France. It also happens to be my pal Adam&rsquo;s birthday. I don&rsquo;t get to hang with him much as he lives in Grand Rapids but I didn&rsquo;t have any plans and convinced Ray to let me head to GR for a couple of hours and buy Adam a beer. After meeting him at his place and a bit of some small talk we headed to <a href="http://newhollandbrew.com/knickerbocker/">The Knickerbocker</a></p>

<p><a href="http://newhollandbrew.com/knickerbocker/">The Knickerbocker</a> is <a href="http://newhollandbrew.com/knickerbocker/"> New Holland Brewery&rsquo;s</a> Grand Rapids location. It is a giant place located right next to the highway not far from downtown. The have different menus for lunch, dinner, happy hour, and event brunch. It has a little bit of everything from an assortment of appetizers to salads to pizzas to sandwiches and even seafood. Here is how they explain it:</p>

<p><em>The Knickerbocker presents a rustic, seasonal menu showcasing local and regional agriculture, old world techniques, with a fresh perspective; including nose to tail butchery, heirloom produce and scratch cooking over fire.</em></p>

<p>The prices are not too bad but not cheap either. I wanted to try the pizza so Adam and I split what they call the Carnivore. This bad boy is about 10 inches and includes pepperoni, ham, bacon, herb sausage, marinara, and mozzarella. Adam put in the order and after finishing off another Mad Hatter, the food finally came out. Without hesitation we dug in.</p>

<p>The pizza was a mouthful. Literally this thing was packed with meat. The meat definitely had plenty of spice. The sausage was a little overwhelming and seemed to be the most prevalent. Behind that, like always, was the bacon. The crust was soft and chewy with what tasted like some garlic seasoning on the bottom. I know there was sauce in there somewhere but didn&rsquo;t stand out much. I suppose there would have to be a lot for it with all of the meat.</p>

<p>The Carnivore was a great choice for dinner. According to the website the price is $14 which in my opinion is well worth it. I hear the pizza pinwheels as great as well so maybe I will try those next time. If you&rsquo;ve never been to  <a href="http://newhollandbrew.com/knickerbocker/">The Knickerbocker</a> and are in Grand Rapids looking for somewhere to go, I highly suggest stopping there. Even for only a beer just to check the place out, you will not be disappointed. And if you hungry, that is even more of reason to stop in.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
