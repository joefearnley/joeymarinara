                                    <h1>Big Joe's Pizza & Deli</h1>
                    <p>Friday night is a perfect night for pizza. I actually stayed in Kalamazoo the entire weekend for the first time in a while so I decided see what my options were around town. I remembered during the chili cook-off there was a newer place downtown called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Big-Joes-Pizza-Deli/306072121722">Big Joe&rsquo;s</a>. I wasn&rsquo;t a big fan of the chili they made but though I would give the pizza a try. I ordered up a large pepperoni and some breadsticks. Ten minutes to pick up.</p>

<p>When I lived downtown I ate at the place that occupied Big Joe&rsquo;s previously a few times. On Saturdays I would order up a calzone, stop at the cigar shop for some beers on the walk to pick it up and head back to my apartment to eat it. I remember the place had an abnormally large seating area for what it was and was always empty. Well, on Friday nights it&rsquo;s not much different. While paying for my pizza I asked the guy how the business was on the weekends. He said it pretty slow but they make up for it during the week with lunch time.</p>

<p>I got the pizza home and popped open the box. The slices were a bit on the thick side. The sauce was tasty but I wasn&rsquo;t too keen on the cheese. I don&rsquo;t know what it was. I am usually a fan of any cheese but something about this stuff just didn&rsquo;t taste right. I wouldn&rsquo;t say it was bad it just wasn&rsquo;t would it could (at least in my opinion). After a couple of slices and a couple of bread sticks I was pretty full and certainly satisfied.</p>

<p>I am not sure if I would get the pizza from Big Joe&rsquo;s again. I know it&rsquo;s not worth a shit in the morning so only order what you think you are going to eat. I would like to try the sandwiches some time. I can&rsquo;t seem to find a menu anywhere online but from what I remember when I was in there they had a lot of options.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
