                                    <h1>Greek Fest</h1>
                    <p>It was an interesting Saturday. I had part of a tree fall in the front yard so that took up all of my morning and part of the afternoon. The other thing on the schedule was the Greek Fest going on all weekend downtown. The weather man said rain all day but the Greek gods must have been looking out for us this day because it turned out to be a beauty.</p>

<p>We all saved up our appetites to tear up some gyros but unfortunately I just don’t do the cucumber sauce. I figure I’d find something else or just order a gyro sans the sauce. So we headed downtown, hit the ticket booth then the beer stand, and finally got to check out the food selection.</p>

<p>I’ve only been to one other Greek fest a few years back and it was at night to see the Gin Blossoms so I don’t remember much and certainly didn’t try any of the food (well that and Adam got kicked out so we left a little early). This year it appeared all of the food was supplied by local restaurant Theo and Stacy’s. I think it would have been a little more appealing if there were other restaurants for a little variety and lower prices but Greek food is Greek food I suppose.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there wasn’t a ton of variety. Gyros, salads, deserts…the usual suspects. They did have hot dogs and french fries for the kids. That was looking appealing until passing one booth where I saw something called Greek pizza. I’ve never seen this type of pie before but the concept is simple. Take some pita break, lay down some marinara and top that with some feta cheese. The choice of toppings were black olives, peppers and gyro meat which in this case I believe was lamb. I went with the olive and meat combo, handed over my seven tickets and was on my way to lunch.</p>

<p>The pizza was pretty good. Nothing special but not bad. The feta was great and combined with the tasty lamb and the fully cooked, almost crusty pita crust it was a little difficult to not go get a second one. I don’t know though, it still was a little lacking. Something was off, it just didn’t seem like a real pizza, almost like a toy. If you ever end up at Greek fest for lunch I would stick with the gyro if you can stomach it. If you don’t get the chance you can always hit up one of the local joints at a more than likely much cheaper price.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
