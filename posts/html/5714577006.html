                                    <h1>Gallagher's Eatery & Pub</h1>
                    <p>Wow, what a weekend. I can&rsquo;t get into too many details of the what or the how but let me just say there will not be one like it for a while. Maybe ever. I had a couple friends come in from out of town (and one stay in town) and before they made their trek back to the windy city we had to meet a carpooler at <a href="http://www.gallagherseatery.com/">Gallagher&rsquo;s</a>. So we headed up to meet Bob and I was in the mood for pizza.</p>

<p>Well not exactly&hellip;it was the only fitting thing on the menu at the time. You see, we used to go to Gallagher&rsquo;s every Monday night for the half-off bottles about 4-5 years ago in hopes to drink all the beers around the world and get a name on a mug. It was a great time, back when several of my friends still lived here. Some of those times Rachel and I would head up there early for dinner and nothing on the menu ever looked or tasted good. I understand it&rsquo;s the pub section (I guess there is an &ldquo;eatery&rdquo; section in the front but I have never been) but nothing I have every ordered for dinner there ever hooked my buds. Yes there is dark wood and Irish stew (and a crummy jukebox) but unless it&rsquo;s St. Patty&rsquo;s Day who&rsquo;s going to be into that shit? </p>

<p>So this particular Sunday was a rainy one in May and it&rsquo;s pretty much dead as a doornail inside Gallagher&rsquo;s . The best looking thing on the menu is the pizza. I went with the three cheese with choice of topping option (pepperoni of course). I wouldn&rsquo;t say that I was completely disappointed by the taste, size and everything about it, I&rsquo;d say it was I was hopeful&hellip;.for something better. They tried, I&rsquo;ll give them that but looking over at Steve and Dave&rsquo;s breakfast burgers my regrets began to beckin. I asked Jack what he thought but don&rsquo;t remember what he said. We&rsquo;ll have to agree to disagree. Next time I&rsquo;ll opt for the BBQ. </p>
