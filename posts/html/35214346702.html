                                    <h1>Woody's Pressbox</h1>
                    <p>Recently there have been a couple recent changes in my work life. My company built a brand new office that we moved in to. Previous to this, most of the employees in the area worked out of a bunch of different offices. Pretty much all of them moved into what has been dubbed <i>The Home Office</i>. My team also hired two new members and one thing we usually do is take them out to lunch their first day. We rounded up some people and head to <a href="http://www.spectrumlanes.com/">Woody&rsquo;s Pressbox</a> which is down the street.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only been to Woody&rsquo;s one other time and that was for after works beers with a couple of teammates. So this was officially my first time eating here. The place is interesting. There is a big bar in the middle that is the first thing you see when you walk in. There is a decently-sized dining area and a bowling alley in the back. They offer a buffet with assorted foods including, salads, tacos, roasted chicken and pizza. Of course as soon as I heard pizza I opted for the buffet.</p>

<p>Once I got my first slice of pie I began to second guess myself. I probably should have done a once over to see what it looked like but I have a blog to write with possible loyal readers. That and I could also opt for a taco if it wasn&rsquo;t very good.</p>

<p>The first round included a slice of the pepperoni and a breadstick. The flavor was pretty sub par. I&rsquo;d equate it to that of a frozen pizza. Not that there is anything wrong with frozen pizza as I eat them all the time it&rsquo;s just that I expect a little more from a restaurant. I went up for more at one point but they were out. I waited a bit and went up to the buffet to find a ham and what appeared to be ground beef pie fresh out of the oven. I&rsquo;d say this version of the pizza might have won me over except for the ground beef. I think it&rsquo;s just one ingredient that should stay off of pizza. </p>

<p>Given a choice, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t go to Woody&rsquo;s again for lunch. At least wouldn&rsquo;t go with the lunch buffet. I did end up having a taco and that wasn&rsquo;t very good. I didn&rsquo;t really look at the other options on the menu to see if there was anything appealing. I&rsquo;ll certainly give it a scan next time.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 2 slices</p>
