                                    <h1>Georgio's</h1>
                    <p>This Friday night began at Hambone Headquarters. AC and I planned a jam sessions to write some new tunes and hopefully at one point hit the town for a couple of beers. Of course I showed up completely unprepared and after a couple of a few hours of playing guitar and drinking beers all I had to eat for dinner was a cup of ramen noodles. So eventually we hit the town to see if anything exciting was happening.</p>

<p>By the time we got to the bar it was after midnight. We stuck it out at Stella&rsquo;s until last call and on our way back to the HQ were on a quest for food. We asked a guy outside the bar if there was any place to grab a quick bite (at least that&rsquo;s how I remember it) and he pointed us toward <a href="http://georgiosgourmetpizza.com/">Georgio&rsquo;s</a>.</p>

<p>The place itself was pretty interesting. I&rsquo;m sure the atmosphere is a little different inside when it&rsquo;s not Friday night at 2 in the morning, but that&rsquo;s what made it a bit exciting. People were lined up out the door to get a slice. I saw a couple drunken arguments, a dude wearing a funny suit and the kid working the register was like every pizza delivery dude that I saw in movies from the late eighties through the early nighties. They had the pies lined up in a Sbarro&rsquo;s-type fashion (actually my guess is they probably do this all pizza-by-the-slice joints in New York but being that I grew up in West Michigan and have never been to New York, Sbarro&rsquo;s is the closest thing I got) so you could pick out the one you want. I got a slice of pepperoni and Adam a slice of pepperoni as well as a slice of Hawaiian (of course).</p>

<p>We grabbed a seat and dug in. It was nice and greasy. The cheese was the real selling point on this slice. The pepperoni was, well, pepperoni and the sauce few and fair between. I found this a good though as the slices were large. If I had to guess I&rsquo;d say about eight inches long. So one was certainly enough. I finished my slice, Adam boxed up his Hawaiian and we set our sights for home.</p>

<p>One of the highlights of the night was when were leaving. There were two guys dressed polo shirts, cargo shorts and birkenstocks trying to fight each other. At least I think that what is was. They chased each other around the mailbox outside swinging at each other as their buddy eating a slice of pizza looked on. I&rsquo;d definitely go return to Georgio&rsquo;s and maybe try some different toppings.  I&rsquo;d doubt it will be as interesting as this night but certainly worth the price of the pie.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
