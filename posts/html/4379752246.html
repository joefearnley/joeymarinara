                    <p>The holiday season is approaching, it&rsquo;s getting damn cold here in Michigan and Rachel and I are hungry. To continue on our quest to find the ultimate pizza we decided to hit up another Kalamazoo Staple: <a href="http://www.bilbospizza.com/">Bilbo&rsquo;s Pizza</a>. It was a slow Wednesday night and the restaruant had a weird vibe going on that night that I can&rsquo;t really explain.</p>

<p>The location on Stadium Drive is closer to our house so that&rsquo;s the one we chose. The restaurant apparently brews its own beer and had a pretty good selection. It also has a Lord of the Rings vibe where everything on the menu is named after something relating to the story. I remember several years back they used to boast about winning some award regarding best pizza in town or something. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d totally agree.</p>

<p>We ended up ordering a small Chicago-style (or was it the stuffed? not sure) with an order of &ldquo;stix&rdquo; and dill dip. Apparently the dill dip is some sort of hot seller that but I really wasn&rsquo;t a fan. The pizza on the other hand was pretty good. Again, it was some sort of this styled with a parmesan crust, thick even more parmesaned sauce, and some mozzarella. We cut the pie into some cute little slices and ate away. Good, not great and I will certainly eat there again.</p>

<p>One thing Rachel would let go was the fact that the staff seemed to all be flirting with each other. I guess you are all college students and it&rsquo;s a slow night but jesus people, this is a place of business. Frankly I don&rsquo;t care what you do at work just always make sure my beer is full. I was able to let it go but Rachel could not and it kind of waned on our dining experience. I think I&rsquo;ve going to have a hard time talking her into going back.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
