                                    <h1>Pool-Side Pizza at The Flamingo</h1>
                    <p><a href="http://joeymarinara.com/post/28092735000/the-great-american-bagel">Like I was saying</a>, you only turn 30 once so I decided to go big. We finally made it to Vegas. Friday night we ended up hitting the town pretty hard. Basically we just walked up and down the strip near our hotel venturing in and out of the various casinos ending back up at our room at about 8 am. I had plans to stay up longer but ended up passing out on our little couch only to wake up to the heat of the desert sun beating down on me through the window a few hours later.</p>

<p>Saturday we ended up hanging by the pool in the later afternoon after hitting Margaritaville for some burgers then wandering around the casino trying to find me a pair of sunglasses. I had only been on this trip for about a day and managed to not only break the sunglasses I brought with me but Jason&rsquo;s as well. Then after the pool we got dolled up and headed down to Fremont St. for some <a href="http://www.heartattackgrill.com/">Heart Attack Grill</a>. That place was interesting. I had to wear hospital gown and got to drink OE out of a paper bag. I don&rsquo;t remember much of how the burger tasted but I do remember them playing videos of the boss at some point on the big screen while we were there. </p>

<p>Once we left the restaurant we wandered down to Fremont St. for a while. Turns out you can pay money to ride a zip line down the covered part of the street. Steve and Lisa ended up going to do that so we caught a cab back to the hotel. After a long day of drinking I pretty much passed out once we got back to our room. This time on the bed only to wake up to salad getting thrown all over me at some point in the middle of the night. It&rsquo;s a long story, will spare the details, didn&rsquo;t really care and fell back asleep for the evening.</p>

<p>Finally Sunday had arrived. I woke up a bit earlier than everyone else and decided to roam the hotel lobby and find something to munch on. I grabbed a beer and some chex mix and headed out to the morning sun to check my email. I was surprised at the amount of wildlife just hanging about the courtyard at this place. At one point a white turkey came up by my table. I guess the thing was pretty tame.</p>

<p>It was our last day and it appeared the line for the pool was a bit shorter at this point. Maybe because it was Sunday or maybe it was because it was just a little earlier. It didn&rsquo;t matter. We made our way down there and ordered some drinks. All I had eaten all day at this point was some pizza was sounding great. I asked a waitress if there was any on the menu. She mentioned that there was so I ordered up a couple of pepperoni&rsquo;s and about 20 minutes later, out they came.</p>

<p>Now as for the pizza. I only remember it being pretty mediocre. It was the type of pizza that&rsquo;s an afterthought. The type that bars or restaurants only offer just so they can say they have it on the menu. Plus we were eating at the pool not a gourmet restaurant so my expectations were not that high. I didn&rsquo;t care, I was really hungry so I dug in and ended up taking about half of one of them down.</p>

<p>Dave brought this special camera with him on the trip that is completely waterproof. Which means not only can you get it wet but you can use it under water. I don&rsquo;t remember who came up with the idea but someone thought it would be great if we snapped some shots of me biting into a slice while having my head dunked under water. After a little back and forth everyone seemed to agree that it was an awesome idea and need to be done. So I grabbed a slice, counted to 3, dunked my head down and took a bite.</p>

<p>The chlorine (and who knows what the hell else was down there) didn&rsquo;t seem to help the taste. It did make for a great photo though. Ahh memories&hellip;</p>

<p>The Flamingo a actually a great place to stay in Las Vegas. It&rsquo;s right in the middle of everything and the rates are pretty good. Turns out they also have a pretty sweet pool to hang out at during the day. As for the pizza&hellip;I would stay away. Hold on to that hunger and get something better. It will be well worth the extra time and money.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
