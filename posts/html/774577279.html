                                    <h1>Handsome Henry's</h1>
                    <p>Lunch with my dad has become some sort of ritual whenever I am in Muskegon. Between that and golf, there does exist things we actually have in common. This particular Saturday I was freed up and we decided to hit up the newly-opened Handsome Henry&rsquo;s. Located in the building that used to be Finley&rsquo;s on Henry St., it&rsquo;s a bit more of an upscale joint with a nice bar that is pretty much the first thing you see as you enter. Big Joe and myself decide to belly up.</p>
<p>The choices for pizza were abundant. Big Joe wanted a burger so I was on my own. I ordered the personal and it came fresh out of the oven with bacon and pepperoni. The crust was thin so I ate pretty much most of it. Sauce was good and the cheese&hellip;well&hellip;it left a little something to be desired. </p>

<p>I do have to say that all in all it was very good. Even better along with a cold Oberon. There was an option for deep dish and chicago style, but rolling solo I was limited on what I could order. Any restaurant can throw pizza on the menu and get a few biters, but this place was a step right above that. Next time, I plan to go bigger. </p>
<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
