                    <p>After not planning a dinner last Friday (as usual) Ray asked me if I wanted to get pizza. She didn&rsquo;t care where it was from so I got to choose. There are a handful of places on my list to try out. I wasn&rsquo;t starving so none of the options really stuck out to me. Eventually I decided on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zalomaspizza/">Zaloma&rsquo;s</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/zalomaspizza/">Zaloma&rsquo;s</a>  is located in the part of Muskegon named Lakeside. I grew right down the street from the location and back then (in the early 90&rsquo;s) it was party store. Since then it has been a number of different businesses. After sitting empty for a while <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zalomaspizza/">Zaloma&rsquo;s</a> moved in around the middle of 2017. The inside is pretty basic with only a counter to order and pay and a bar that goes around the outside with some stools and a couple of high tables. The menu is pretty basic as well including a handful of signature pies with names like the lil&rsquo; clucker, razorback, and the funky veggie that come in only a 12” and 16” size. I ordered a pepperoni and bacon 16” for takeout, picked it up 15 minutes later and headed back home to eat it.</p>

<p>As soon as I got home I grabbed a beer and dug into the pie. The crust was a bit flowery and chewy. Each slice was pretty greasy from the cheese and bacon combination. It certainly had some spiciness to it. Attempting some detective work on it I could not figure out if it was coming from the pepperoni, the sauce, or both. The combination of them though was excellent. The slices were fairly small so I ended up eating about 4 or 5 of them.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/zalomaspizza/">Zaloma&rsquo;s</a> is a great addition to revitalization of the Lakeside neighborhood. I hope they last a long time there. With <a href="http://joeymarinara.com/post/66840298325/habs">Hab&rsquo;s</a> recently <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/muskegon/index.ssf/2018/03/muskegon_favorite_habs_good_ea.html">closing up shop</a> down the road, the odds of that happening are pretty good. If you are in the Lakeside area make sure you give <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zalomaspizza/">Zaloma&rsquo;s</a> a shot. Don&rsquo;t expect to be grabbing a pie after Marine Tap closes because they close a little early.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
