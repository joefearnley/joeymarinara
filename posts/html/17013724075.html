                                    <h1>Palermo Pizza</h1>
                    <p>Recently I have been settling into my new job that happens to be in a new location so with that comes options. Options for lunch. I&rsquo;ve been scoping out the restaurants in the area especially the pizza joints. The problem with eating at pizza joints at lunch is the way in which the pizzas are served. Unless the restaurant offers a lunch buffet or by the slice you really have to order an entire pie to get the full experience. I guess you could wrangle a couple of your co-workers to go with you but I am still new here so I am working on that.</p>

<p>One option is to order a small but I feel that tends to derive from that full experience I was mentioned earlier. But that all depends on where you go. At least that&rsquo;s the trend I&rsquo;ve been experiencing. It just so happens that even though I work in what I would consider a &ldquo;suburban&rdquo; area I just so happened to pass one of these joints I was researching this past Friday and what do you know, they sell pizza by the slice. I had to stop at the bank which is located in the same plaza as <a href="http://www.palermo-pizza.com/">Palermo Pizza</a>. I didn&rsquo;t have any plans for lunch so I stopped in and grabbed a couple of slices to go.</p>

<p>The one thing about pizza by the slice is you are never guaranteed anything going in. On this particular day I had the option to wait about ten minutes until a pepperoni was ready or I could go with what was ready at the time. The options were ham, some sort of vegetable-only and what I would consider a &ldquo;meat lovers&rdquo;. I opted for one ham and one &ldquo;meat lovers&rdquo;. My total was under five dollars for a couple decent-sized slices. I paid the cashier, left a tip in the jar and headed back to the office to eat.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t read any reviews prior to trying Palermo so I was going in blind. It was basic pizza. I&rsquo;d say similar to a Sbarro&rsquo;s but better. It was thicker than your typical New York style but not that thick. It had chewy crust that kind of enhanced the toppings a bit. I have to say I liked the &ldquo;meat lovers&rdquo; better out of the two but I think that was only because of the bacon. The sauce was decent and the cheese left a little to be desired. I think that was because it was sitting for a while before I ordered it and sat for another five or so minutes in the car ride back to the office.</p>

<p>Palermo Pizza seems like a cool joint. According to their website there are family-owned and there are about 7 of them around the West Michigan area. This particular one only had seating for about two people in the inside so it was pretty much carry-out only. Overall my first experience there (and the first around the area I work) was a good one. I think it has a lot of potential and is suggested by at least one of my coworkers. I&rsquo;d like to try it fresh out of the oven one day, maybe even one of the twenty four inchers that they claim to.</p>
