                    <p>I had some training over the course of the week so I was basically locked in a room learning about a java-based reporting tool. It was fun stuff and I learned a lot. They originally said that we had to supply our own lunch for the week which was fine by me but someone messed up and they ended up bringing in lunch every day. One of the days happened to be pizza. I wasnâ€™t complaining. Free food and it was pizza. Count me in.</p>

<p>Apparently the pizza was from a place called <a href="http://www.jbspizzaparlor.com/">JB&rsquo;s Pizza Parlor</a> in Grand Rapids. I&rsquo;m not sure the exact location but apparently my employer orders it on a regular basis for employee lunches so I am assuming they are a customer. There were a few options to chose from. By the time I got a chance to grab what I wanted, I weent with a slice of pepperoni and a slice of what appeared to be meat lovers. The other options were deluxe, cheese (I think) and some sort of chicken barbecue. I would have liked to try the chicken barbecue but it was gone by the time I went for seconds. Perhaps next time.</p>

<p>As for the pizza, it was a basic thin crust. Not too thin but enough to be considered that. It seemed that the pies had been sitting a while as they seemed to have cooled off a bit by they time we got ahold of them. The cheese was beginning to harden and the crust was a little tough. I ended up taking in three slices which was plenty to keep me full for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Overall JB&rsquo;s wasn&rsquo;t half bad. I was again in one of those situations where I wondered what it tasted like fresh out of the oven. Also, looking back, being that name of the place has &ldquo;gourmet&rdquo; in it I would expect something a little bit better. Try it if you want but you can easily fine much better pizza in the area.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 2 slices</p>
