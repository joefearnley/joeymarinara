                                    <h1>The Hangar</h1>
                    <p>It&rsquo;s a warm Tuesday night what better way to spend it than getting some cold beer and wood-fired pizza. Rachel and I decided to hit up The Hangar: our local, airplane-hangar-themed restaurant. We kind of wore this place out after moving to where we live now, but it made sense on this particular evening.</p>
<p>The place is actually a pretty descent sports bar. There are TV&rsquo;s everywhere that always has something on special (be sure to check out what they have cooking on Friday nights). It makes a great place to watch the wings play. And of course they have pizza. Wood-fired to be exact with a bunch of different options ranging from BBQ chicken to margarita. I chose the flight plan where you basically build your own keeping it simple with pepperoni and black olives. </p>
<p>In all honesty, the pizza wasn&rsquo;t anything special. It&rsquo;s wood-fired so if you&rsquo;re into that sort of thing it&rsquo;s probably right up your alley. They are served in a 9&quot; option as sort of a personal size (there may be other options for bigger ones, something I have never tried to order). I took most of it down and saved the rest for lunch the next day. This combined with a cold blue moon it really hit the spot. </p>

<p>This wasn&rsquo;t the first time I&rsquo;ve had the pizza at The Hangar and certainly won&rsquo;t be the last. I&rsquo;ve tried a few other things on the menu and it seems to be the only I keep coming back too. Next time I will have to change the flight plan up, maybe add a little flair.</p>
<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
