                                    <h1>The Chateau</h1>
                    <p>I&rsquo;ve never been the east cost before. I think the furthest that way I have been is Pittsburgh. This summer I had to go to Massachusetts for work. My company acquired a smaller company in Taunton, MA which is somewhere between Providence, RI and Boston. Kind of in the middle of nowhere.</p>

<p>After somewhat of a long first day we finally made it back to the hotel. Getting up at 3:30 in the morning will only tire you out but also make you hungry. Restaurants around the area were few and far between. On of my coworkers had been out there before and mentioned a place a few minutes away that had a nice seafood and pasta menu called <a href="http://www.chateaurestaurant.com/">The Chateau</a>. We all agreed it sounded good and headed over.</p>

<p>The first thing you notice when entering The Chateau is a big sign above the entrance that read &ldquo;Lobsterpalooza&rdquo;. This was the east coast, lobster is a staple and they were letting you know. The inside was very nice and overlooked the lake on the backside. Once seated were ordered some beers and checked out the menu. I&rsquo;m not a big seafood person and the menu was full of it. I haven&rsquo;t been into pasta in a while as it tends to pack on the pounds. I also knew I was probably going to be eating way more than usually on this trip and didn&rsquo;t want to stuff myself (as I usually do with pasta). </p>

<p>Finally I noticed pizza on the menu. They offered individual sizes that you basically build your own. I was debating between the lobster Mac &lsquo;n Cheese or pizza and ultimately went with the pizza. I ordered an individual with pepperoni and black olives along with another &ldquo;beea&rdquo; (Boston for beer). </p>

</p>

<p>My pizza finally came out and looked delicious. The pepperoni was cut into triangles which didn&rsquo;t change the taste but made it look a little different. The first slice was pretty tasty. The pepperoni was a little bit on the spicy side and the cheese melted nicely. The one thing that stood out to me was the lack of marinara on pie. I don&rsquo;t why but it almost seemed like there wasn&rsquo;t any on it. In the end I was completely satisfied with my decision. I even left with an extra piece or two and not because it was bad.</p>

<p>If, for whatever reason, you find yourself in the Taunton area and are looking for a place to eat I would say good luck. The options are limited. If you are into seafood and pasta certainly check out The Chateau. If you are in the mood for pizza, I&rsquo;d look elsewhere. We did end up going back there a few nights later and I got the lobster Mac 'n Cheese. I wasn&rsquo;t that impressed. Again, I&rsquo;m not a seafood guy.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 Slices</p>
