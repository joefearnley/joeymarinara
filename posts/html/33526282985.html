                                    <h1>Kalamazoo Beer Exchange</h1>
                    <p>So this past Saturday ended up being a doozy. Dave, Brandon and I hit the town and from what I remember hit up about 6 or 7 different bars once the night was over. Only to end up over on Ravin Road somewhere. All I wanted to do was hit up the Sky Deck but it just wasn&rsquo;t in the cards. Oh well, there is always next summer. I don&rsquo;t think that place is going anywhere. Of course before we went out we had to fill up on a good hearty meal (which actually didn&rsquo;t end up being the last). We wanted to show Brando what <a href="http://kalamazoobeerexchange.com/">The Beer Exchange</a> was all about so we headed downtown.</p>

<p>For those of you not familiar with the Beer Exchange its a bar/restaurant where the price of the beer goes up or down depending on what people are buying. Fro instance, take Bud Light. Let&rsquo;s say the price of a pint is usually $4. If more people are buying Bud Light, the price will increase to $6 a pint. If no one is buying it, the price of a pint drops to $2. The price changes every 15 minutes and the actual price is different depending on the beer. Unfortunately for us, it didn&rsquo;t start until like 6pm and it was only 4 at the moment.</p>

<p>I remembered seeing pizza served the first time I was here. I&rsquo;ve only eaten here one other time in which we just ordered a bunch of appetizers. Turns out the only pizza they offer is a margherita. I&rsquo;m not usually a fan of this style of pie. To be honest, I am not a fan of tomatoes on my pizza let alone whole slices. I figure that&rsquo;s what the marinara is there for but this was, after all , a margherita. Regardless, the option was there so Rachel and I ended up splitting the pizza and a cheeseburger.</p>

<p>On to the pizza. This was your typical margherita pizza with from what I could tell a wheat crust. I am not very particular to the wheat crust. I save that for my sandwiches. I was originally going to ask the waitress if I could get some sort of meat (preferably pepperoni as Brando suggested) on it as an extra topping to beef up the protein but forgot once she came and went.</p>

<p>It came out fresh, covered in mozzarella, tomato, basil and I think olive oil somewhere there in the mix. The crust was little tough, but you&rsquo;ll have that with the wheat. The olive oil made up for and always seem to with these style pies. At this point I was really hungry and a couple Bell&rsquo;s Oracle Double IPA&rsquo;s deep so really, anything would have tasted good</p>

<p>The beer exchange is certainly a place you have to hit up at least once for the novelty. The food is pretty good too. I probably wouldn&rsquo;t order the pizza again and most likely stick with the wings. Although, from what I remember, the nachos were pretty good too. They offer main fare as well as stuff for the kiddies. Maybe next time I&rsquo;ll give the meat loaf to go.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 Slices</p>
