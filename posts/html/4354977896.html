                    <p>I was in Muskegon for Thanksgiving and having a four day weekend and seeing your family in the first one, things get a little boring. Indeed that Friday eventually turned into what some would call quite the shit show (including a house part with break dancing) and it all started around lunch time at Marine Tap Room.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t particularly hungry at the time but some one ordered up a few pizzas which I think were on special for $5 for lunch. I was offered a couple slices and rolled with it. Even though I was a few beers deep I can&rsquo;t say that the taste was bad. I think that sold it for me was the cheese. I&rsquo;ve had better but I&rsquo;ve had a lot worse.</p>

<p>Even though hunger pains were not trolling through my body I could have probably taken down an entire pie that day. The weather was cold but the combination of cheap beer and cheap pizza did it for me. I&rsquo;ll probably never go to the tap room looking for pizza again but it&rsquo;s nice to say that I experienced it once.</p>
