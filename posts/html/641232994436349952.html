                    <p>Well, it&rsquo;s officially a wrap. We all survived our first trip to Disney World. I&rsquo;m personally ready to get back home but it seems everyone else was a little bummed we were leaving. Anyone who has traveled knows the trip back is always a fun one especially when it includes two little ones. We packed up our shit and grabbed the bus back to the airport hoping things would go smoothly.</p>

<p>The line for the TSA check at the Orlando airport was pretty long. I&rsquo;m sure it is quite the hub at most times and can&rsquo;t image what it is like in early April. Late September was no exception but after a lot of standing around and following orders we made it through and close to our terminal. With a couple of hours to kill we decided to see what options were around us for lunch. In one of the spots there was a Burger King, a donut shop who&rsquo;s name escapes me, and a pizza place called <a href="https://famousfamiglia.com/">Famous Famiglia</a>. The pizza place was the most interesting to me so as always, after getting everyone situated I grabbed a slice from the pizza place.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d never hear of <a href="https://famousfamiglia.com/">Famous Famiglia&rsquo;s</a> before and it reminded me a lot of Sbarro&rsquo;s. It had a hand full of pizza options along with some strombolis, bread sticks, and pasta. I wasn&rsquo;t looking to get too crazy with lunch here so I opted for a basic slice of pepperoni and headed back to the family to eat.</p>

<p>It was a surprising good pie. I suppose anything is tasty after sitting in a line for an hour and a half but I really liked it. The sauce a a little lacking but the cheese and pepperoni definitely made up for it. AFter polishing off a slice I honestly wish i had another one but the line was way to long and we had to catch our plane.</p>

<p>In a pinch <a href="https://famousfamiglia.com/">Famous Famiglia&rsquo;s</a> is a very good option. According to their website they are located mostly in malls and airports. Airport food sucks for the most part but if you stumble upon one of these and your only other option is the big fast food chains I would say you should check them out.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
