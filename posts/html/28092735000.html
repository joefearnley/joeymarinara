                                    <h1>The Great American Bagel</h1>
                    <p>It&rsquo;s that time of year again. I am rounding out my twenties by taking a trip with a few pals of mine to Las Vegas. Dave, Jason and I we leaving from Grand Rapids to meet a couple of others that were already there. I had the afternoon off of work so that gave me a little time to pack and generally &ldquo;gear up&rdquo; for the flight. Once Rachel got out of work we headed north to the airport.</p>

<p>I guess it&rsquo;s been a really long time since I&rsquo;ve been in the Grand Rapids airport because for some reason I remember it being a lot bigger. After getting through security we made our way to the terminal only to wait another hour before boarding begins&hellip;you know the routine. Just as luck would have it though right by our terminal was a <a href="http://www.greatamericanbagel.com/">Great American Bagel</a> with a bar next to it. I can&rsquo;t imagine this was the same establishment because even though I think this was my first time visiting a Great American Bagel I&rsquo;m pretty sure they don&rsquo;t serve alcohol yet it was occupying the same space in the Airport. I guess it really doesn&rsquo;t matter. Regardless we posted up and order some beers.</p>

<p>At this point in the evening I hadn&rsquo;t eaten dinner yet and the beers were making me tipsy. The bagel joint had a variety of sandwiches including some sort of pizza/bagel/sandwich concoction. Dave and Jason suggested I try it out. According to the waitress they had on left so I ordered it up and went back to my seat. </p>

<p>This got me thinking. Since they only had one left means they either pre make them at the restaurant or they get shipped there that way? I don&rsquo;t know if one is better than the other but I had to wonder why they didn&rsquo;t just make it on the fly. A few minutes later out it came.</p>

<p>Once it came out I kind of starred at the thing for a moment, basically just trying to figure out what it was. Some sort of loaf of cheese-covered bread? I didn&rsquo;t care. At this point I was a little drunk and was hungry. Once biting into it I realized it was basically a large bagel with some sort of cheese and a little marinara mixed in. Soft and very doughy. I would only get some marinara once I got to the middle of the thing. I wouldn&rsquo;t say it was the worst thing I&rsquo;ve tasted, but it wasn&rsquo;t very good. Given the situation I was in I took what was available.</p>

<p>Ultimately our plane ended up getting delayed for three hours. Needless to say we were feeling pretty good by the time we got on board. And I know technically this place is a chain but I thought given the circumstances of where I was and being egged on I basically committed to this review. I don&rsquo;t think I would ever visit this place for the pizza bagel but I would certainly give the breakfast a go. Maybe then my plan will be on time. This was going to be a fun trip.</p>
