                                    <h1>Hungry As A Wolf</h1>
                    <p>
We had our first family trip up north this past weekend and went up north to <a href="https://www.greatwolf.com/traverse-city">Great Wolf Lodge</a> for a couple of days. For those unfamiliar, <a href="https://www.greatwolf.com/traverse-city">Great Wolf Lodge</a> is a resort with an outdoor/camping theme aimed at children. Similar to Disney but on a much smaller scale. Along with an arcade, miniature golf, and bowling, the main attraction is the water park.The one we went to is located in Traverse City which is about three hours away. We got up on Wednesday morning and hit the road. The trip wasn&rsquo;t bad going up as it is always nice to see northern Michigan in the springtime.</p>

<p>After settling into our room we had plenty of time left in the day to hit the water park so we took advantage. After a couple hours of water-filled adventure we got dry and hit <a href="https://www.greatwolf.com/traverse-city/dining-shopping/dining/camp-critter-bar-grille">the main restaurant</a> for dinner. That was about it for the boys for the day so we headed to bed. The next morning after breakfast and some cartoons, we hit the water park again. Everyone started to get hungry after an hour so we got some lunch.</p>

<p>There was a food stand named <a href="https://www.greatwolf.com/traverse-city/dining-shopping/dining/buckets-incredible-craveables">
Buckets Incredible Craveables</a> located right in the park. There wass also a pizza and sandwich place named <a href="https://www.greatwolf.com/traverse-city/dining-shopping/dining/hungry-wolf">Hungry As A Wolf</a> located right outside. I wanted pizza but the family wanted hot dogs. I ordered the hot dogs and while I waited for them to cook I stepped outside the park to grab a slice.</p>

<p>After getting the kids set up with their food I dug into the pizza. The picture doesn&rsquo;t really do it justice as it was a fairly large slice. It was Brooklyn style pizza that I could get a nice fold going on with and was really greasy. The flavors the cheese and pepperoni combination were great. Unfortunately I had plenty of water time left for the day so I only had one slice.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say the food is exceptional at <a href="https://www.greatwolf.com/traverse-city">Great Wolf Lodge</a> but for a place of its size, there were plenty of options. I think I paid around $3 for the slice of pizza I had and from what I understood, I could get a whole pie for around $20. Obviously it is not cheap but for the convenience factor it was worth it to me. It wasn&rsquo;t the best slice I&rsquo;ve ever had but it defintely satisfied <a href="http://joeymarinara.com/post/160174385494/jets-bold-fold">my craving for a New York slice I had a while back</a>. I wish there was a place like this at home.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
