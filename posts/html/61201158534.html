                    <p>So it begins. My summer vacation to the west coast. There is a lot planned for this next week. It&rsquo;s going to be action packed. Plenty of sightseeing, plenty of food and plenty of drinks. Our trek started in Chicago. We chose to do a park and fly out of O'Hare to prevent from having to get up at the crack of dawn. I took the cheap route and got us a hotel located in Elk Grove. I&rsquo;d never been to this area and had no idea where it was.</p>

<p>I tried to get an early jump on the travel to hit up Al&rsquo;s Beef or attempt to hit a pizza spot for dinner. Unfortunately that didn&rsquo;t happen and the hotel was located on the complete opposite side from where we enter the area which added another 30 minutes to our travel time. I held out on eating on the way there. I figured if all else failed I could always grab some fast food. But doing a little googling on the way I discovered there was a <a href="http://www.loumalnatis.com/">Lou Malnati&rsquo;s</a> right around the corner from our hotel. I don&rsquo;t think it could have worked out any better.</p>

<p>As soon as we got settled into our hotel room I ordered up a pie. I chose a 9 inch deep dish with pepperoni as the topping.  I was told it would be ready in about 30 minutes. I headed there with plenty of time to spare as I wanted to make a pitstop at a beer store in the area for beverage. Luckily for me there was a liquor store a block away from the restaurant. I stopped in to pick up a couple of tall boys and made my way down the destination.</p>

<p>Upon entering the I was greeted by the hostess who took my name and let me know my food would be right up. As I waited I scoped out the restaurant. It had an early American frontier vibe to it. I don’t know what the significance of this was and couldn’t seem to find any information about it. They also had a cooler of frozen pies to go next to the door. Apparently they will ship you one anywhere in the country. Finally my order came out and I headed back to the hotel.</p>

<p>Once there I opened the box and it smelled amazing. I wasted no time and dug right in. I wasn’t sure how far I was going to get looking at how big the pieces were. The cheese was just right, not overbearing. I think that’s what makes a good Chicago style pie. The sauce was somewhere right in the middle. Not over bearing either, just enough. The crust was a little crunchy and a little too flaky for my liking. </p>

<p>Talking to a couple of others about my experience with the crust they mentioned it was great because it was so buttery. I don’t know how but somehow I missed this. My crust didn’t seem buttery at all. I began to wonder if I had to order it a special way. I think that too bad because that was the one thing that prevented this pie from almost tipping the scales. In the end I was able to only take down two slices. Given the size I was pretty satisfied with myself.</p>

<p>I admit, as much as I like deep dish pizza I haven&rsquo;t done much research on what Chicago has to offer. I&rsquo;d heard of Lou Malnati&rsquo;s but that was about it. I&rsquo;d like to one day hit all of the big names and Lou Malnati&rsquo;s was a great start. Hopefully next time I will get to dine in. I&rsquo;ll also have to get some advice on how to order the proper crust.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
