                    <p>So I guess summer is almost over. I know I had one hell of one. If this past weekend was a way to say goodbye to it, I&rsquo;d say we did it in great fashion. In Muskegon none the less. Friday night we hit a beer tent and finished at the Sand Bar. Saturday was tubing all day on the river and a pool party/cookout later on in the evening. So what should we do on Sunday? Well the sun is still shining and I didn&rsquo;t have to work on Monday. We decided to hit the beach and pack a cooler.</p>

<p>We decided on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pere_Marquette_Beach">Pere Marquette</a> as the spot for the day. It seemed abnormally windy that day and the beers were flowing. We spent a couple hours on the beach and then decided to hit up <a href="http://www.myspace.com/captainjacksonthebeach">Captain Jack&rsquo;s</a> for some lunch and a couple more brew dogs. Part of the trouble was finding shoes for everyone to get into the place. Dan ended up with Craig&rsquo;s dress shoes which made this venture a funny from the get go.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only been to this place a handful of times. Since moving out of Muskegon right after turning twenty-one and it only being open a few months out of the year it&rsquo;s one of the last choices to hit on a night out when in town. This particular afternoon was a pleasant one. We sat out on the deck while a one-man band did his thing a few feet away. The guy didn&rsquo;t know and Bruce Springsteen but the menu did offer five-dollar pizza pies. We ordered up a couple along with a few more beers.</p>

<p> Unfortunately, there isn&rsquo;t much to say about the pizza. A five-dollar pizza is a five-dollar pizza anyway you slice it. (heeyoooo!). It was the typical situation where I think they put it on the menu just to have it. Cardboard crust, generic meats and way too much cheese. I only had a few slices which was a good way to save room for the fast food consumed around 2 a.m. after hanging out at MiBar afterward.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d certainly go back to Captain Jack&rsquo;s again, but probably won&rsquo;t order the pizza. Maybe try something else on the menu. While we were there a guy next to us asked if the pizza was worth the five dollars. I replied with &ldquo;Yes, but not a penny more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Final Rating: 2 slices</p>
