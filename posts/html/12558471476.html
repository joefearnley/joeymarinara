                    <p>Another Friday was up and another decision was to be made as to where to go to lunch. I actually wasn&rsquo;t originally planning on going out for lunch as I had an extra half of a sub in the fridge ready to go but I was feeling a little cooped up in the office so I figured some fresh air and non-work conversation would help. We decided on <a href="http://paisanosbarandgrill.com/">Paisano&rsquo;s</a> and off we went. </p>

<p>Paisano&rsquo;s is an alright joint. It&rsquo;s kind of a bar and grille with an Italian name. Which makes it sort of feel like an Italian joint even though it isn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve only been there for the occasional lunch and a couple times after work to catch happy hour. I imagine though it gets pretty jumpin&rsquo; come ten o'clock on a Saturday night. Especially with the limitation on night life in Three Rivers.</p>

<p>The menu contains everything from appetizers to pizza and pasta to salads to burgers. And still for some reason I still look at this place as Italian. Regardless I usually get one of the sub sandwiches but today I opted for the pizza. They offered a few different options for specialties but I stuck with the pepperoni and cheese and ordered up a twelve-incher for myself.</p>

<p>The pizza came out hot and fresh. I soon realized that the 8 inch option might have been a wiser choice. I was pleasantly surprised by the party cut and a party it was. The pie had a lot of fluff to it reminding me very much of <a href="http://joeymarinara.com/post/11597054151/bilbos-pan">Bilbo&rsquo;s pan version</a> The cheese was piled high but I felt like something was uneven about it. Like it was cooked more in some part than others. Not to say the taste was bad because it wasn&rsquo;t. It just seemed like it could have been tightened up a little bit.</p>

<p>All in all, I thought the pizza landed somewhere in the middle. I was only able to finish half of it before I had to throw in the towel. I can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s a must for ordering it you ever make it to Paisano&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;d stick with one of the sandwiches or wraps. But if your are with a group and feel like pizza, I&rsquo;d say go for it maybe try out one of the specialties. If your any sort of connoisseur, the pepperoni probably won&rsquo;t do it for you it. </p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
