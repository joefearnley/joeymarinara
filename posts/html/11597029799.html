                    <p>Well, hockey (my men&rsquo;s hockey league that is) is officially over and my Sunday nights are now free. This means no rockin&rsquo; pool parties with beer and Early Times then having to go play a game. Actually it pretty much means the same thing except I don&rsquo;t have to go play hockey. Party!! This also means no more free pizza after my games because of so much ass kicking. That&rsquo;s right, I now have to buy my own.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s okay though, I really haven&rsquo;t had a free Sunday like this since the fall season began last October. I was doing some work around the house, the hunger was creepin&rsquo; and all I could think about was pizza. I have a list of places around town I want to try and review so I called a couple, no dice, then <a href="http://www.bimbospizza.com/">Bimbo&rsquo;s</a> answered the phone and took my order. Large cheese and pepperoni for takeout. </p>

<p>At first, I was a little hesitant. I have had <a href="http://www.bimbospizza.com/">Bimbo&rsquo;s</a> before dining in at the restuarant in downtown Kalamazoo and I have the the experience was bad. It was slow, there was one lady working, and the service was god awful. Needless to say it wasn&rsquo;t enough to have me back regardless of the taste. This particular afternoon I figured what the hell, let&rsquo;s give it another shot. So I ordered it up (without realizing they actually deliver with this <a href="https://s-hphotos-iad1.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/313128_10150325742357485_170824182484_8110795_2125130390_n.jpg">funny-looking, old-timey</a> car that I happened to get right behind the following day) and picked it up twenty minutes later greeted by a staff of four at the counter. Something tells me things have changed in the last few years. That or I was there on a <i>really</i> off day.</p>

<p>I got the pie home, opened it up and son of a bitch if they didn&rsquo;t party cut that shit. That&rsquo;s right a fourteen incher hot and ready to go. I&rsquo;d be lying if I didn&rsquo;t say I was drooling just looking at the thing. Maybe it was the fasting or maybe it was the beer I was drinking all day. Didn&rsquo;t matter, it was on.</p>

<p>On the the pizza. I guess I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed by this pie, it just left a shit-ton to be desired. I will give the cheese and the sauce the higher ranking here but if the crust wasn&rsquo;t a flowery, hardened piece of wanna-be bread, I could have rated this shit higher. Leaving your customer with white finger tips is not a way I like to go out. The combination just didn&rsquo;t do it for me.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like to hate. Hell, if I could love every pizza joint I go to I would. I gave this place a second chance and it just didn&rsquo;t do it for me. There&rsquo;s a chance I&rsquo;ll be trying Bimbo&rsquo;s again in the future but I know I&rsquo;m not paying for it.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
