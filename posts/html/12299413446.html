                                    <h1>Bruno's</h1>
                    <p>I&rsquo;ve been wanting to check out Bruno&rsquo;s for a long time. Even when I spent every day on Western&rsquo;s campus I never made it into the place. This particular Wednesday we needed something for dinner, decided on pizza and went with Bruno&rsquo;s. I called up and ordered a large pepperoni and cheese, ready in twenty minutes.</p>

<p>For those of you who don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s located a few block from WMU&rsquo;s campus right across the street from the track. If you drive anywhere near the area, it is really had to miss the sign outside. I&rsquo;m not sure when the place originally opened but something tells me not a whole lot has changed with the place since then. It has a lot of character, especially inside. It reminds me of an old diner with a counter up front and a video game machine ready to be played. As I was walking in the pick up the pizza I saw that had a guy in the window (in the kitchen really) spinning some dough in the air building a hand-crafted pie. This is my kind of place. If you do plan to eat here, I&rsquo;d suggest dining in. I have yet to do it and still plan to. </p>

<p>I got the pizza home and cracked the box. Of course it was party cut (I&rsquo;m not completely sure how to say correctly, still figuring it out) so that was cool. Except as far as the grid is concerned I think they missed a side because it had some really elongated slices mixed in there. The taste overall was great. I mean, I don&rsquo;t really know what else to say. I suppose they could have put more toppings as I felt like I was doing a lot of hunting and pecking for the pepperoni. I don&rsquo;t like a ton of peps on my shit but I think they slacked a little in that department. In the immortal words of Joe Clark&hellip;.&ldquo;Defeat is not bitter unless you swallow it.&rdquo; Words to live by kids.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that I don&rsquo;t have any pictures of the actual pizza. I took some but lost them while upgrading my phones operating system and I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out how to get them back. So I resorted to taking a picture of the building to add something visual to this entry. I'l update this post with more pictures the next time I go. Hopefully with some of the inside as well.</p>
