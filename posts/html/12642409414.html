                                    <h1>Monelli's</h1>
                    <p>This past weekend I spent most of Saturday at GR DevDay at Calvin College in Grand Rapids. It’s basically a one-day, multi-track software development conference. It was only $10 for the day and that included food, little swag and a chance to win an iPad. I learned a lot about the mobile development space which was basically why I was attending as well as the state of JavaScript and a little about Python. Did you know that Android has the biggest market share of mobile devices? Neither did I.</p>

<p>So enough with the boring stuff, let me get done to why I am writing this. The lunch for the day happened to be catered by <a href="http://www.monellis.com/">Monelli&rsquo;s</a>, as Italian grill and sports bar located somewhere on the southern side of town, technically in Wyoming. They had quite the spread going. Salad, spaghetti, fettuccini alfredo, lasagna, pizza and break sticks. I wasn’t really sure what I wanted, I was a little overwhelmed but ended deciding on pizza and bread sticks, with a little fettuccini on the side. </p>

<p>By the time I got up to spot where I fill my plate, there were a couple of different options for the pizza. Once was some sort of vegetarian that looked really good and the other was peperoni, ham and cheese combination. I went with the meat, grabbed a couple of bread sticks, a Mountain Dew and was off to time a place to sit during the lighting talks they had over lunch. </p>

<p>The pizza reminded me a lot of Papa John’s. Thick but not too thick with the right amount of toppings. It did taste like it was sitting for a while as does most food when it’s catered like this situation. The crust was soft enough that it wasn’t tough to bite into. They also had some extra marinara on hand for dipping the bread sticks and crust. As for the sticks those little buttery nuggets left me wanting more after two. If I had a plate of only those things I would have been completely satisfied. The combination of the pie and sticks was a surprising treat to the day and if I wanted seconds there was plenty more.</p>

<p>I immediately regretted the fettuccini as I finished. Not that it wasn’t good, it’s just every time I eat fettuccini alfredo anymore it reminds me of that <a href="http://%E2%80%9D" http:>episode from The Office</a> where Michaels takes down an entire plate of it and tries to run a 5K. I was so full and I had an entire afternoon of talks  to site through. I rectified the situation by grabbing a cup of coffee before the first one (and filling up a few times throughout the afternoon). If I do ever get the chance, I’d like to check out Monelli’s actual restaurant to see what else the place has to offer.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
