                    <p>Well, we made it. After a slow morning getting on the plane, a 3.5 hour flight over the Rockies, we landed at LAX with while it was still the morning on west coast. Flying is never fun unless of course you fly Virgin America. This was my first experience and was a good one. I wouldn’t say it was the most amazing experience I’ve had on a plane (I hope that is yet to come) but they had TV, wifi and all the (non-alcoholic) drinks I could take down. It certainly made for a comfortable ride.</p>

<p>We were staying in Marina Del Ray which after getting a lay of the land realized our hotel was across the street from Venice and only a few blocks from the ocean. Once settled in our room we took a stroll down to the Venice pier and had lunch at The Whaler. After that we walked down the Venice Beach to do a little people watching. I was offered a few different CDs, marijuana and was asked if I had seen Jesus lately. The place was pretty wild and would love to go back. </p>

<p>Tuckered out after a day and a half of travel we headed back to the hotel to take a snooze. I woke up around dinner time pretty hungry. Rachel was out like a light. I did a little research and noticed there was a <a href="http://www.frankieandjohnniespizzamarina.com/">Frankie &amp; Johnnie’s Pizza</a> next to the hotel. After another try and no response from Rachel I headed over to see what they offered. </p>

<p>The place was located in a small strip mall on the other side of the block our hotel was on. It was your typical pizza joint with a counter to order at and a few table and chair combinations for dining in. They offered pizza by the slice and whole pies if you were willing to wait. The options at the time were limited. The only pizza they had slices available for we pepperoni and mushroom as well as mushroom and spinach. I grabbed on of each and headed back to the hotel room.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed about these slices were how big they were. The pictures here don’t really do them justice. They were definitely the New York style you had to fold in half. The crust was a bit on the chewy side but was felt fitting given the size of these things. The sauce was pretty sweet and the cheese tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. Not exactly melted but was still a good mix. Regardless they were a satisfying end to a long day.</p>

<p>My first experience in California was pretty cool. I was given some suggestions via facebook for places to eat in the area but unfortunately didn’t get to try any of them. And I’m sure Frankie &amp; Johnnie’s is the best pizza in the area but it sure was convenient. Great for a late night grub or quick lunch. Other than that though I’d look elsewhere if I were in the area again. </p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
