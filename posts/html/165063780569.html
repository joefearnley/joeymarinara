                                    <h1>Peppino's Pizzeria & Sports Grille</h1>
                    <p>Last weekend was a fun one. I got to stand up for my pal Craig while he got married. We golfed, ate some great food, drank a bunch of beer, and eventually danced the night away. The rehearsal was on Friday at the <a href="http://downtownmarketgr.com" target="_blank">Downtown Market</a> in Grand Rapids. After finding out what I had to do on the big day, the groomsmen decided to head to <a href="https://www.peppinospizza.com" target="_blank">Peppino’s</a> for lunch.</p>

<p>With all that has happened in downtown Grand Rapids over the last several years, <a href="https://www.peppinospizza.com/%E2%80%9D">Peppino’s</a> has been a staple.<a href="Dhttp://joeymarinara.com/post/12301879011/peppinos-pizzeria-sports-grille" target="_blank"> I’ve written about them before</a> and it looks like since then they have expanded to multiple locations around West Michigan. The Downtown location offers just about everything you could image a menu would hold along with what they are typically know for, pizza.</p>

<p>On Fridays they have a buffet with all sorts of options like salad, wings, ribs, pasta, and of course, pizza. After milling over the menu a bit, I decided to go with the buffet and headed up for my first plate. I was really planning on only eating the pizza, so I skipped most of stuff and went right to the pizza. A fresh pepperoni just came out so I grabbed a couple of slices of that along with a breadstick and some marinara and headed back to my seat to eat.</p>

<p>The pizza was very fresh and very good. It was super greasy and loaded with plenty of cheese. I am a fan of dipping the pizza in the sauce from time to time and gave it a go here. I found the sauce to be a bit bland adding nothing to the pizza. I certainly could have gone without it. Breadsticks were very good as well. They were buttery and garlic and small, which to me is a good thing.</p>

<p>I ventured out a bit on my second trip to the buffet. I grabbed a little pasta, some wings, another breadstick, and a slice of what appeared to be bacon, sausage, and black olive. The size of the slice was way bigger that I thought. It had a ton of cheese on it and the sausage and bacon mix was great. The black olive added even more saltiness to each bite. As for the wings, they we breaded and didn’t have any heat on them. I could have done without those as well. After two plates and a beer, I was stuffed.</p>

<p>It is always difficult to decide where to eat in with all of the great options in downtown Grand Rapids. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.peppinospizza.com" target="_blank">Peppino’s</a> always tends to get overlooked when we’re there. I’m not particularly a fan of buffets and I don’t usually eat that much but if you are I’d highly suggest this one as it not only has pizza but a bunch of other options. You can get filled up very easily for fairly cheap. To most, that is a good thing.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
