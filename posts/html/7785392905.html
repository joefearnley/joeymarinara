                                    <h1>The Strutt</h1>
                    <p>The other night one of the bands I play in, <a href="http://protectedleft.org/">Protected Left</a>, played in Kalamazoo at <a href="http://thestrutt.com/">The Strutt</a>. The place has only been around a couple of years. I think before it was The Strutt it was a coffee house with a different name and according to some fellows at work was a record shop back in the nineties. Over the last year I&rsquo;ve been to this place quite a few times mainly to see bands play, never really to just hang out. So of course, I&rsquo;ve never tried their food.</p>

<p>If you can handle the hipsters it&rsquo;s not a bad place to hang. Since we were playing last I was kind of forced to hang out there for a few hours. I hadn&rsquo;t eaten dinner yet so I asked for a menu. Overall everything looked pretty tasty. I was expecting food snob&rsquo;s paradise with vegan versions of everything. But they kept it real. And of course, they had pizza.</p>

<p>Basically they offer one size: the 14 inche (I think). There were a bunch of different options combinations you could order (see the selection on <a href="http://thestrutt.com/Pizzas.php">the menu</a>) or you could roll your own. Mario soon got wind of me wanted to order pizza and offered to split one with me. The problem was though, Mario is a vegetarian and to keep things consistent for Joey Marinara I always order pepperoni sometimes with an additional meat variant. I waiter offered to split the topping but I decided to take the high road and let Mario decide the toppings.</p>

<p>We ended up with mozzarella and feta cheeses along with spinach and roasted red peppers. I don&rsquo;t mind the cheese or even the spinach (thanks to one time in Chicago) but I&rsquo;ve never been a fan of peppers on the pie. I figured hey, let&rsquo;s mix it up a bit and rolled with it.</p>

</p>

<p>The pizza came out super warm and we decided to head outside to eat (apparently they don&rsquo;t turn the air on in The Strutt if only ten people show up to your show). Even after getting a couple smells off the pizza I was still a little weary about the toppings but after the first bite all was clear. For me it was all about the cheese. The mozzarella and feta combo was a match made in heaven. There could have been green beans stuff in the inside of that thing and it wouldn&rsquo;t have mattered, I would have taken it in.</p>

</p>

<p>Once all was said and done I probably ate too much. We didn&rsquo;t start playing until after midnight so I had plenty of time to digest everything. I&rsquo;d like to give this place this pizza another shot to try out some meatier toppings. I&rsquo;m beginning to learn that what goes on top can drastically make a difference in taste.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
