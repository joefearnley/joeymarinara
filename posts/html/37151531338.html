                    <p>I was back near the lakeshore over the weekend to show the little one off a little and eat some thanksgiving dinner. It&rsquo;s always a nice little four-day weekend which is almost always spent entirely in Muskegon. Thought last year Rachel and I did our own thing by heading out to Pittsburgh for a long weekend to see some sites and watch hockey. Thinking back, I don&rsquo;t think we ate at any pizza while out there which is kind of a bummer. I remember researching a couple but one was in kind of a dicey part of town so we never went. Regardless this year it was back to the same ol&rsquo;.</p>

<p>My in-laws live near a place called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Pic-N-Pac/146665398690800">Pic &lsquo;n Pac</a> in Norton Shores, MI. For those of you that are unaware, it&rsquo;s a gas start/mini convenience store located in the heart of city. Actually there isn&rsquo;t really a place like it for a mile or two so it works out well for those in the area. I usually stop there to buy some beer. One particular evening over the course of my stay I stopped in and also picked up a slice of some pizza that looks like it had been sitting out for a day or two.</p>

<p>The place offers all kinds of different ready-to-eat food including sandwiches, rolls and of course, pizza. When I was in highschool my buddy Dave and I would roll up to place on our lunch break, order some chicken fries and a slice of pizza and eat it while listening to Steve Howe&rsquo;s solo album in Dave&rsquo;s car. I wonder if they still make those chicken fries. Anyway, I grabbed my beer and pizza and headed out the door.</p>

<p>I actually ended eating the slice in the car on the way to the in-laws. It was the typical type of pizza you&rsquo;d find at any of the school cafeterias in the area. Burnt, hardened cheese, pepperoni chunks and a crust that was along the lines of cardboard. I did finish it though. The taste though took me back to my younger days when the menu didn&rsquo;t have choices. It memorable and satisfying at the same time.</p>

<p>Pic 'n Pac is a great convenience store. The staff will always give you a hello when you enter and are willing to help you find anything. I&rsquo;d stick with the sandwiches though. The pizza certainly won&rsquo;t keep you coming back.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 2 slices</p>
