                                    <h1>Rose's on Reed's Lake</h1>
                    <p>This year I didn&rsquo;t go home for Thanksgiving. Ray and I decided to take a vacation and didn&rsquo;t go home to see the family. Needless to say I think my parents were missing me and wanted to meet in Grand Rapids for a meal. I suggested the regular bar/restaurants downtown but no one was biting. As we ironed out the schedule the only time that seemed that was going to work was a Sunday morning. The only breakfast joint I&rsquo;ve ever been to is the place in Easttown next to Mulligan&rsquo;s that escapes me at the moment and I didn&rsquo;t think my parents down for that. Ultimately we decided on Rose&rsquo;s on Reed&rsquo;s Lake.</p>

<p>This place is located deep in the bowels of East Grand Rapids. A place I&rsquo;ve never really ventured into other than the times I was looking for Mario&rsquo;s house and somehow missed it then drove an extra eight blocks and the houses got really nice. They only thing I really know about this part of town is that American Pie&rsquo;s filming locations were based on it, I went to the high school once to get my picture taken during high school hockey and there was a doctor that was once on American Greed that lived somewhere on Reed&rsquo;s Lake.</p>

<p>Rose&rsquo;s offered us a special breakfast menu with about eight things to choose from. It had been a long weekend and I&rsquo;m not much of a breakfast food person. As soon as I saw the breakfast pizza on the menu it not only sounded delicious but was the closest thing I could get as far as lunch is concerned. I was sold.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to remind you that I am not a huge fan of breakfast food. I especially don&rsquo;t like egg on anything but toasted bread. In this case though, I think I had a change of heart. Basically the pizza was a breakfast plate on top of pizza crust with salsa as the sauce. Egg, sausage, potato and cheese rounded out this bad boy. It pretty much tasted exactly like you think it would. Good.</p>

<p>Whenever I think of pizza for breakfast it&rsquo;s the cold, leftover whatever-the-hell-I-ordred-at-two-in-the-morning the night before. In this case it was totally different. I didn&rsquo;t know what to expect for a breakfast pizza and was once again pleasantly surprised. If you get the chance to check this plate out I&rsquo;d suggest it. I&rsquo;m giving this one it&rsquo;s rating for creativity.  </p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
