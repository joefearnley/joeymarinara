                    <p>So I think I got the eastern Massachusetts accent figured out. Basically, it translates to a midwestern accent like this:</p>

<ul><li>Ar  -&gt; ah</li>
<li>Ah  -&gt; aw</li>
<li>Er  -&gt; uh</li>
<li>Ure -&gt; ore</li>
</ul><p>Like I mentioned in my last post, the restaurants were pretty limited in the area we were staying at. One of the only bar and grille&rsquo;s in the area was a place called <a href="http://www.homeplate.us.com/">Homeplate</a>. It was a typical sports bar. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.homeplate.us.com/">Homeplate</a> also happened to be a customer of the company we acquired (so our customer now). While we were there they catered a couple of lunches over the weekend while employees were going through some training in the office.  Needless to say I got a custom to their cuisine by the time I left. </p>

<p>On one of the last nights we were there, we had a long day and another early morning to be back in the office. So once again we ended up back at home plate. At this point, other than the pizza, I had only tried the wings from there. I was debating between a different type of pizza or the stuffed burger. I don&rsquo;t know why, but the stuffed burger seemed a little much at the time. I ended up going with a chicken bacon ranch personal pie and a can of this IPA they call <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/joefearnley/9572089330/in/photostream/">Green Monsta.</a></p>

<p>The pizza came out shortly there after. I was starving at this point and dug right in. It was hot but I didn&rsquo;t care. The way the curst, cheese and bacon all melted together was like a blessing in my mouth. The chicken and ranch just added to the mayhem. I don&rsquo;t know what it was. The crust was chewy and flavors abundant. It almost tasted like a hot sandwich you&rsquo;d get but not toasted.</p>

<p>In the end I took down &frac34; of the pie. I was debating on more but being that we had a somewhat early morning and probably wouldn&rsquo;t have time to stop for breakfast I started to think ahead. I was fairly certain this stuff was going to taste pretty good at 6:00 am. In the end, I was right. I scarfed down a couple of slices first thing the next morning and felt great. A couple of hours later I was in full swing. </p>

<p>I have to hand to Homeplate. Each night we were there the owner of the place came out and thanked us. He was happy to have us. That makes for a great dining experience. If there is anyone in the Taunton, MA reading this that hasn&rsquo;t been to Homeplate. All I can say is you&rsquo;re missing out. Give it a try as soon as you can.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 Slices</p>
