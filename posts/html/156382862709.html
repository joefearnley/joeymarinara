                                    <h1>Grand Pizza & Beer Fest</h1>
                    <p>Last weekend was a fun one. We didn’t have much planned and decided to check an event in Grand Haven called the <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/muskegon/index.ssf/2014/03/winner_of_pizza_pie_eating_con.html">Grand Pizza &amp; Beer Fest</a>. It was held at the Grand Haven Community Center next to the library. Basically, you pay a fee to get in and they give you tickets to either sample beer or pizza.</p>

<p>When you entered, there was a main hallway where all of the breweries were set up. A handful of them were offering up samples including Acoustic Mead, New Holland Brewery, Odd Side Ales, Osgood Brewing, Unruly Brewing, and Vander Mill. They ever were also having making shift games in the area with prizes like inflatable beer mugs and beer mug glasses. After trying a couple of IPAs and a stout we decided to hit the main room for some pie.</p>

<p>In the main room, the pizza vendors are located at both ends of the room, the seating was in the middle, and at the front was a DJ playing some music. We found a seat and took a look at what the options were Clover Bar, Jet&rsquo;s,  Marco&rsquo;s, Mr. Scrib&rsquo;s, Old Boys&rsquo;, and Pizza Hut. Vander Mill was also in the room dishing out donuts if that was your bag.</p>

<p>They served up the slices in a sample size, which for most vendors was not quite enough. I think the only one I hadn’t tried before was Old Boys’.  I was really impressed with it. It was some sort of meat lovers pie with giardiniera as an option which lead to a great combination. Pretty much every place there were serving pepperoni and cheese except Scribs’ which was serving deluxe.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we didn’t stick around for the pizza eating competition that was at the end of the event. The main room was pretty crowded and Zig was getting restless after being there a while. We decided to take off and spend our last couple of tickets on some more beer samples before we left. All in all it was a fun event and I hope they do it again next year.</p>
