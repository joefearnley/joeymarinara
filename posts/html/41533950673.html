                                    <h1>Pangea's</h1>
                    <p>As newish parents Rachel and I decided to take a weekend to get away. There was a deal that the Grand Traverse Resort was putting together that consisted of lodging at the hotel and a local brewery tour around Traverse City. The tour was on Saturday so we decided to go up Friday night and maybe catch a little of the town. Of course I started scoping pizza joints in the area. Most seemed to be mom and pop places that were mainly take out. Although after being there is seems that a lot of other restaurants including the breweries that offer pizza but a simple google search doesn&rsquo;t seem to get you that far.</p>

<p>Eventually I decided on <a href="http://www.pangeaspizza.com/">Pangea&rsquo;s</a> based on the yelp reviews and the fact that they sold micro brews on tap. Once we arrived in town we unloaded at the hotel and headed downtown. The hotel is kind of off the main drag so it took about ten minutes got down there. Which wasn&rsquo;t bad at all and it gave us a little time to take in some local scenery on the way.</p>

<p>Pangea&rsquo;s is located in the heart of downtown Traverse City. Being a Friday night I thought it may be a little difficult to find a parking spot. After cruising through the main drag then around to the back of the building we found a spot, parked and headed in. The place itself was fairly small. It could be considered what I&rsquo;ve heard been called a hallway bar. It had an eclectic vibe to it and reminded me a lot of <a href="http://joeymarinara.com/post/34911874879/brick-road-pizza">Brickroad Pizza</a> in Grand Rapids. This apparently turns some people off but I kind of dug it. They also have outdoor seating in the warmer months that would be cool to check out some time. </p>

<p>We got seated quickly and soon ordered an huma lupa licious. The menu was offered a lot of options including a bunch of specialty pizzas that people raved about on Yelp. The group next to us ordered a pepperoni that looked awesome so we ordered a 12&quot; version of that and waited for it come out.</p>

<p>It was a little late at this point and after driving for a few hours I was starving. Ten minutes later the waitress brought out the pie and I dug in. It was cooked to perfection and covered in pepperoni. The main thing that I noticed about it was how sweet the sauce was. You could also taste the seasoning the sauce but I couldn&rsquo;t put my finger on it. The pepperoni was a bit on the cooked side but the crunchiness added to the flavor very nicely.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d definitely check out Pangea&rsquo;s again and I would suggest others to do the same. Preferably, I would pick next time to be in the summer because sitting outside there would be rad. I&rsquo;d also like to check out some of the specialty pizzas they have have to offer. Then maybe go back a third time to check out the Chicago style. You never know.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 4 slices</p>
