                    <p>I&rsquo;m going to keep this one short and sweet. Let me set the stage for you&hellip;my buddy Craig and I rise before the rest of the bunch and are both hungry. And when I say rise, I&rsquo;m talking like 11:00 a.m. on a Monday. That&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s Memorial Day and the every one else can&rsquo;t get out of bed so it was off to first call. It was a long day and night.</p>

<p>The problem with trying to hit hit up a restaurant on a national holiday is that you never know what is open. I suggested Burdick&rsquo;s first. I called the bizzarro location first, they said they were open, and after trying to walk into the one downtown and them not being open, it was on to our second choice: <a href="http://www.universityroadhouse.com/">University Roadhouse</a>. I certainly didn&rsquo;t want the banker salad so the next logical choice was pizza.</p>

<p>I ordred the &ldquo;famous&rdquo; as a personal 12&quot; topped with pepperoni, bacon and black olives. There&rsquo;s not a whole lot to explain here. It was cooked and the ingredients made it to the pie. So I can&rsquo;t complain. It was in the middle somewhere. I have no other way to explain it. I suppose the only better way would be to fragment it.</p>
