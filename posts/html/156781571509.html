                                    <h1>Jet’s Valentine Pie</h1>
                    <p>Valentine’s Day has to be the worst “holiday” in the world. All we need as human beings these days is more candy, meaningless gifts, and flowers (let’s be honest, plants) that are destine to die in a week. But also as humans (specifically those in the USA), are culturally expected to gift their significant other something, usually in the form of items previously noted.</p>

<p>This year for Valentine’s Day, I brought home some flowers for Rachel after work, which she seemed to like. We talked about what we were going to do for dinner. With no babysitter and no plans, we decided that going out to dinner was not an option (nor that it would be a good idea on Valentine’s Day). I was fumbling through the local ads to get some ideas and saw that <a href="http://jetspizza.com/" target="_blank">Jet’s</a> was doing offering a heart-shaped pizza. We quickly decided on that for dinner and began looking at options.</p>

<p><a href="http://jetspizza.com/" target="_blank">Jet’s</a> offered the pie with whatever toppings we wanted and ended up ordering two of them; one pepperoni and one Hawaiian. I wanted some beers and we didn’t have any so I ordered to pick it up. I head out to get the pizza along with a beer store stop and was back in about 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Once home, we opened the boxes and dug in. The crust of the pizza was that similar to their deep dish style, only not as deep, even though the photo in the ad made it look like the “regular” pizzas the offer. It also tasted the same as the regular deep dish pizza. The cheese was melted perfect with a golden brown outside. I ate about half of the pepperoni pie and tried a couple of bites of the Hawaiian. With a couple of beers to accompany it, that was enough to satisfy me on Valentine’s Day.</p>

<p>My love affair goes back pretty far with <a href="http://jetspizza.com/" target="_blank">Jet’s</a>. I had my first one in college and never looked back. Now locations all over West Michigan you the option for <a href="http://jetspizza.com/" target="_blank">Jet’s</a> pretty much everywhere. The heart-shaped version of the pizza was no exception to what they regularly offer. Apparently they are only running these around Valentine’s Day so if like the gimmick and want hope on the heart-shaped <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woW3LE6jB5g" target="_blank">pizza train</a>, now would be the time.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
