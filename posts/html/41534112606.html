                                    <h1>Jack's Sports Bar at Grand Traverse Resort</h1>
                    <p>Well, the day had finally come. The Traverse City brewery tour was an hour away and we had friends to make. On tap for the day was North Peak, The Filling station and Right Brain. The night before, <a href="http://joeymarinara.com/post/41533950673/pangeas">we hit up Pangea&rsquo;s</a> and the Mackinaw Brewing Company for some sample flights to get us warmed up. We had to meet at <a href="http://www.grandtraverseresort.com/dining/bar-en.html">the sports bar in the resort called Jack&rsquo;s</a> which was basically a bar filled with TVs and a bunch of pictures of Jack Nicklaus. I guess if you design a golf course next door the least they could do is name a bar after you. You&rsquo;d think being the greatest golfer ever would be enough.</p>

<p>The meet and greet at the bar was anything but that. Although they gave us a name tag and offered up a buffet of pizzas for lunch. We ended up getting some breakfast a couple hours prior so I wasn&rsquo;t that hungry. Pizza is pizza and it is a really bad idea to head out on a brewery tour with anything but a full stomach so I ordered a Bud Light and grabbed a couple of slices from the buffet.</p>

<p>The first slice was a meat trio consisting of pepperoni, sausage and ham. It wasn&rsquo;t too bad although I wasn&rsquo;t expecting much. The pies were 10&quot; so the slices were pretty small. I also got a couple of slices of the barbecue chicken which Rachel really ended up liking. The pizzas really hit the spot. I was full and ready to try some beers.</p>

<p>The tour turned out to be a blast. They actually offered pizza at The Filling Station (which has a sweet custom pizza over that I failed to get a picture of) and at North Peak. I was bummed I didn&rsquo;t get a personal pie at each of the places just to try and they even offered to called ahead at North Peak. Oh well, maybe next time. I think I am going to try and make this a yearly thing. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p>Final Rating: 3 slices</p>
