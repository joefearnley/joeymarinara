If you remember a while back [I went out to dinner and drinks with my pal A.C. before a rock show](http://joeymarinara.com/post/157960268564/blue-dog-tavern). Well, in a month or so, he is getting hitched. And what’s a proper wedding without a proper bachelor party? I don’t remember being involved in the destination decision but we ended up going to Windsor, Ontario for a weekend to celebrate Adam’s last few weeks as a single man. The last time I was there was about 13 years ago so I really didn’t know what to expect.

No grand plans were really set in stone so we pretty much played it by ear the entire weekend. On the first night we did dinner and drinks and more drinks with a night on the town .Boy that was a rough one. After getting 408’d upon returning to the hotel, I made it to my bed safe and sound.

The next day a few of us woke up and decided to do a little exploring of the city. We stayed at the Caesars, which from what I could tell, is located in the downtown area of Windsor. We strolled down by the river before heading into the thick of it. After checking out a little local color we decided to stop for a bite to eat. As things were still a little hazy at this point in the day for me, I don’t remember why we decided on it, but ended up at a place called [Pizza Pizza](http://www.pizzapizza.ca/).

The place was a like a Canadian version of Little Caesars, which is totally ironic [with a name like Pizza Pizza](http://%E2%80%9D). It was pretty much a fast food joint offering takeout for the most part. They had a bunch of slices of pizza available for lunch. I decided to keep it simple and order a couple of slices of pepperoni with a Diet Coke.

The moment I bit into the pizza it was pretty obvious it had been sitting around a while. The cheese was dried up, the pepperoni was also dry with a little crispiness to it, and the crust tasted like cardboard. I think I paid around $5 for the combo, and I was technically on vacation, so I didn’t feel too scammed when I left the place and at least I was full.

Windsor is kind of a weird town. It seems like there was a lot going on there at some point but the general vibe seemed a little bleak. The nightlife is still busy and if you are into gambling, Caesars Windsor would be a great destination for you. As far as pizza is concerned though, I would steer clear of [Pizza Pizza](http://www.pizzapizza.ca/) unless you’re a in a pinch. I can’t confirm, but I have to think there are many other options around town.

Final Rating: 2 slices
