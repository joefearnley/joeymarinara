It was another Friday in the office and someone earlier in the week brought up [Jasper’s](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Jaspares-Pizza-and-Fine-Italian-Food/190057067047) as a possible lunch outing open to anyone who wanted to go. They just opened a new location in the area and they offer a lunch buffet. For $7.50 you get a drink of choice and all the pizza, salad, and bread sticks you can eat. I’ve [blogged about Jasper’s before](http://joeymarinara.com/post/4284189557/jaspares-pizza) and I remembered it being very good. I was sold and off we went.

The new place is pretty cool. I’ve never been in any of their other locations before so I have nothing to compare it too but it was a typical pizza/Italian joint with lots of red, green, and white on everything. I ordered my spot on the buffet and was off to check things out. Unfortunately we must have showed up a little late for the lunch crowd as it was slim pickin’s at the buffet by the time we got there. What was pretty cool was the kid working behind the counter (who happened to be another 80’s-pizza-delivery type with bleached-blonde hair and all) came out and asked us what we wanted and he’d go back and make it. Shortly there after the dude came out with a meat lovers, BBQ chicken and another stuffed pie.

The pizza had all the elements of a classic. Great crust, juicy meats, melted cheese, and a great tasting sauce. The bread sticks were made with some sort of seasoning and parmesan. They were like crack. I wish I could have had more but my stomach was putting it’s foot down and I still had to go back to work for the afternoon and try not to fall asleep. Turns out they never refilled the salad bar while I was there but it really didn’t matter, it would have just got in the way.

All in all, the Jaspare’s buffet experience was a pleasant one. When I do go again, I would like to try the calzone there. One of the my co-workers ordered one and the thing was the size of a football and looked delicious. Options are limited in Three Rivers so I am sure I’ll be back.
