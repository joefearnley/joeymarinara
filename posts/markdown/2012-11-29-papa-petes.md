I didn’t have hockey this past weekend. Not to say that I don’t miss it and should be picking up an extra sticks and pucks to stay on top of my game but sometimes you just need a day to relax. Especially with a new little one hanging around. I knew that my weekend would be somewhat uneventful going into it and planned to have pizza at least one night. Sunday rolled around, I had leaves to bag and I still didn’t have any pizza.

This was also the day we decided to hit up a restaurant as a family. Rachel and I are used to eating out five nights a week so this past month and a half have been a little interesting as far as the dinner thing goes. Learning to cook is one thing but the ease of eating is a completely other level. We hit up Burdicks earlier in the day and it didn’t really go that well. Later in the day, after a couple of beers, leaf bagging and no pizza, I started to look at my options. I had only heard good things about [Papa Pete’s](http://www.papapete.net/) pizza and that they have a killer deal on Sunday take out pies, so I called them up.

I’m not sure if the guy on the phone and I were on the same page but I was trying to figure out what my choices were for pizza. I tried to get an idea of what the price may be but after some runaround and a few questions, I decided on two mediums pies, $6.50 a piece. Dave was at the house so we decided to head down there and grab a couple of beers while they cooked.

[Papa Pete’s](http://www.papapete.net/) is an interesting place. It’s located in downtown Kalamazoo and is connected to a greek restaurant named The Blue Dolphin. I’ve never been to The Blue Dolphin but have been to Papa Pete’s plenty of times. Most of which were to see a band or two play and on a couple of occasions just to hang out and shoot a little pool or play foosball. There was weird vibe there that night. It was a Sunday and was like soul night or something with a DJ. Regardless, we finished up the beers, grabbed the pies and headed home.

Once back at the house we opened the first pizza up. It looked and smelled great. I grabbed a couple of slices and headed to the living room. It had a thinner crust and was very cheesy. The sauce was no slouch itself adding a great mix of tomato and spices to round out a great pizza. The cheese and pepperoni was melted perfectly together. I think I ended up taking down almost half a pie in a sitting. It was very addicting.

If I had to suggest checking out a cheap pizza joint on a Sunday, I would definitely suggest Papa Pete’s. Although I’ve been there a bunch of times, I don’t think I ever ate the food there. Rachel and I have a hard time decided what should be on the menu for the evening. This just might turn into a regular thing for us.

Final Rating: 4 slices
