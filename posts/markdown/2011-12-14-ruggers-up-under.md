I’ve been to a handful of bachelor parties in my adult life. When it comes to my friends, the same thing usually ends up happening. There will be lots of food, alcohol, bad choices and a trip to an adult establishment at one point over the corse of the night or weekend. This time, it was Jason’s turn. He is getting married next Saturday and we made plans to head to Detroit to see the Red Wings take on the Winnipeg Jets. All the years growing up playing travel hockey and spending a considerable amount of time in Detroit, I actually have never been to the Joe Louis Arena or a Red Wings game. Needless to say I was totally stoked and the more we talked about it over the summer and fall, the more the idea of doing only one night made less and less sense. So we made it two.

Being that the decision to make a weekend out of it came together somewhat last minute, we didn’t make hotel arrangements for Friday night. So we ended up hanging out in Kalamazoo for the night. The original plan was to head up to Tiffany’s for some good beers, hangout at the Brownout, maybe play some NHL hockey and order some pizza at some point. Well after everyone showed up the consensus was to hit the town and do something for the evening. I don’t remember why but ened up heading up to [Up and Under](#http://www.ruggersupandunder.com%20).

Typically I head to Up and Under to watch the Red Wings as they have some pretty sweet deals on beer and chicken wings during the game. The only pizza I remember seeing the menu ever was a french-bread style on special once. Tonight there was a personal pizza on special for $4.99. It was 9:30 at this point and I was still looking for a pizza fix so I ordered one up. Steve and Dave had the same idea so they ordered one as well. Along with a Foster’s oil can, of course.

When the pies came out I was surprised at how small they were. After finishing one I think I could have eaten one or two more. Maybe I was just really hungry. Anyway, I don’t want to knock the restuarant or the cook or whoever made this pizza but I have to say it’s probably the worst pizza I’ve ever eaten. I think it’s safe to say they probably bought a bunch of these pre made from the food distributor for a discount. It was like a really bad frozen pizza I would have cooked at home. And for some reason I kept tasting barbecue sauce while eating it. Dave said he kept tasting mexican seasoning while eating his.

I certainly won’t stop going to Up & Under but I certainly will never eat their pizza again. To be honest, I’ve never been a big fan of their food in general. It’s definitely more of a grab a beer with the guys type of place. Although if you are in a pinch and waiting until later is not an option I’d go for the sliders. It’s really hard to mess those things up.

Final Rating: 1 slice
