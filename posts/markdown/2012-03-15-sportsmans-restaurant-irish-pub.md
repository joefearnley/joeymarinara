Wow, what a weekend. I was invited back again this year for the annual hockey tournament in Ludington, MI. I am currently used to playing only once a week and after packing in five games in a weekend I am completely bushed. I did have a lot of fun though. Spent some times with my pals, played some hockey, drank some beer, and of course, ate some pizza. There is not a whole lot going on in Ludington at the beginning of March but there were a couple of places on our radar to check out. And check them out we did.

Friday night was an interesting one. We actually won our first game by a good margin and hit the town to celebrate. Again there isn’t much open in downtown Ludington in March (even on a Friday Night) and that includes places that serve food. So we drank on empty stomachs and raided the Shell station next door to the hotel at two in the morning looking for sandwiches. Mission accomplished.

Saturday morning came a little too early. We had the first game at 10am, the first of the day against arguably the best team in the tournament. We pretty much had to win the first three games to get to the finals or get really lucky on some point technicality. We lost and were somewhat hoping for the former but regardless, it was lunch time. We made a pit stop at the hotel after the game headed downtown for some grub.

I somehow convinced everyone we should got to this place called [Sportsman’s](http://sportsmansirishpub.com/) as I remebered from last year they had some pretty good pizza. Jason was pushing for some barbeque joint called Butts & Rubs or something and after asking the waitress about it, we found out it was closed for the season. I didn’t bad after that.

As for Sportsman;s, it’s a little deceiving. It coins itself an “Irish Pub and Grille”. Now don’t get me wrong, they do have Guiness on tap and leprechauns on the wall but also serve the best domestic drafts you can think of and have burritos and pizza on the menu. Who knows. I didn’t really get it but I already knew what I wanted so I ordered up a large pepperoni pie and a beer.

Jason and I decided to split a sixteen inch pizza. It came out hot and party-cut into fairly small slices. They really only serve thin crust here which was fine by me. I had another game to play later and didn’t want to fill up too much. The cheese and crust had a respectable taste and the one major thing lacking was the sauce. It was almost non-existent. I’m not one for a ton of sauce on a pie but give me some to work with. Let’s just say I was a little disappointed at this point.

All in all Sportsman’s was pretty good. We actually forgot out leftovers at the restaurant so I didn’t get a chance to taste it not being from out of the oven. The service was pretty good although they forgot Captain America’s (Casey) order but I think comped him for it. He ordered a specialty pizza that consisted of spinach, chicken and some sort of white sauce. He actually gave me some and it was good.
