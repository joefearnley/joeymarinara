Last week was a short one at work and I didn’t prepare at all for lunch so decided to eat out each day. I figured if I was going to let things ride this week I might as well squeeze another pizza place. I am starting to run out of pizza places around my office and am now forced to look at other areas of Holland. Downtown has a few places that offer pizza, but not really by the slice. One of those places was [Subs-N-More](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Subs-N-More/116682795058456), so I decided to give it a shot.

I’ve been to [Subs-N-More](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Subs-N-More/116682795058456) before when I lived in downtown Kalamazoo, hitting it up on a couple of Saturdays while Ray was at work. That location ended up [closing up](http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2008/10/downtown_kalamazoo_subsnmore_r.html) right around the time I was living there. [According to the MLive article](http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2008/10/downtown_kalamazoo_subsnmore_r.html) there were once 11 of these places around the area but I can’t seem to find much information about them. There was also [a location in downtown Grand Rapids a few years ago](http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2012/04/former_quiznos_shop_to_get_new.html) but [it ultimately threw in the towel](http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2013/09/subs-n-more_closes_downtown_ne.html) as well. It appears the only locations I could find these days are [one in Holland](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Subs-N-More/116682795058456) and [one in South Haven](https://www.facebook.com/Subs-N-More-262580423808286).

[Subs-N-More](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Subs-N-More/116682795058456) is just that – a sub shop that also offers pizza, salads, and a hand full of appetizers. As for pizza, they offer full pies as well as by the slice. Because of the horrible winter weather and the traffic downtown, it took a while, but I finally made it. I ordered two slices of pepperoni along with a drink and grabbed a seat while it cooked.

After about 15 minutes my pizza came out and I was presented with what looked like 2, 1 and a ½ slices of pizza. I’m not sure if that is what I ordered or that is how they serve them. Granted, I didn’t pay much attention to the menu so that certainly could be the case. Regardless I dug in.

The pizza must have come right of the oven because it was extremely hot so it took me a while before I could take the first bite. The cheese, which was plentiful and tasty, was a little over done to the point where it was oozing off the side of the slices. The curst was soft in the middle and had a little crunch on the bottom and exposed ends. The pepperoni and sauce were about as basic as you could get. There seemed to be a lot of fluff on this pizza with not a whole lot of bite that drew me in.

Unfortunately I have to agree with most of the comment on Sub-N-More’s [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Subs-N-More/116682795058456) [pages](#%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.facebook.com/Subs-N-More-262580423808286%E2%80%9D) as far as the service was concerned there. The staff didn’t explain to me at all what I was getting when I ordered and seemed like they would have liked to be anywhere but working there at the moment. I have to say that those around me that ordered subs looked like they were getting a very good meal. With all of the options downtown Holland has for type of food [Subs-N-More](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Subs-N-More/116682795058456) offers, I can’t honestly suggest it to anyone and I probably won’t be back.

Final Rating: 2 slices
