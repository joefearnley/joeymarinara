For Ray’s birthday we decided to take a long weekend and head down to Chicago. We booked a hotel downtown right on the river and had grand plans of sightseeing including the aquarium, Navy Pier, and possibly even Willis Tower. We also had some plans to meet up with our friends Steve and Lisa who live in the Andersonville neighborhood as they promised me deep dish pizza and beer sometime over the weekend from this place named [Tedino’s](http://www.tedinos.com/)

Our hotel was only a few blocks away from Navy Pier so that is the first thing we hit up. We did a little shopping, grabbed a snack, and hit up the children’s museum. After a couple of hours, Zig was pretty much done, so we headed back to the hotel. Steve just happened to be downtown for some work-related event and offered to pick us up on his way back home.

After a nice little ride down Lakeshore Drive we arrived at our friend’s place. There is a pizza joint around the corner called Tedino’s that Steve was telling me for a while that I need to try. It’s an Italian restaurant that offers appetizers, pizza, burgers, salads, and pasta. We ordered a pepperoni deep dish and cracked a couple of colds ones while we wanted.

After a while of catching up, Steve went and picked up the pizza. He returned about five minutes later, pizza box in hand, ready for consumption. I dug right in. The slices were pretty good sized. The cheese was melted to perfection and the sauce was a little tangy and has some heat to it. The crust was nice and crispy on the bottom as we didn’t let it get soggy at all. I finished off a full slice and split another with Ray. That combined with a couple IPAs I was completely satisfied.

People always complain about how the Chicago style deep dish pizza really isn’t pizza. I’m completely on the other side of the fence on that one. I love it and being that it is not that easy find around West Michigan I just on the chance to eat when I can. This occasion was no different and the convenience of [Tedino’s](http://www.tedinos.com/) being around the corner sealed the deal for me. I wouldn’t put it on the must visit/eat at list of Chicago but if you find yourself in the Edgewater area and are looking for some great deep dish, look no further than [Tedino’s](http://www.tedinos.com/).

Final Rating: 4 slices
