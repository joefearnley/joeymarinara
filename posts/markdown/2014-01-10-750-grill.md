The holidays are over but I had a few days off to spend with the family. One was a Saturday which Ray let me pick where to go for lunch. I wanted to check out a few pizza spots in the Muskegon area and ultimately ended on [750 Grill](http://750grill.com/). I didn’t know much about the place other than I’ve passed it a bunch of times on my way north of two to golf and that a friend of mine used to work there. Regardless, I knew they had pizza so off we went.

[750 Grill](http://750grill.com/) is located on Whitehall Rd. in North Muskegon. It offers a full bar and a menu filled with everything from pizza to omelets to fish to a lunch buffet during the week. Upon arrival we were informed that on Saturdays, the 14” pizza were only $10. Ray and I couldn’t decide on what exactly to get, so we ordered two pies - one taco and one meatsa.

They sat us right next to the salad bar so I ordered that while we waited for the pizza. There was nothing special there, but a little ranch dressing and lettuce never hurts anyone. Once I finished the salad the pizza arrived. The first thought that crossed my mind was “this is a lot of pizza for $20”. Then I dug in.

The pizza was party cut so I took a slice from the edge and one from the middle. It was at a nice temperature by the time I took my first bite. The sauce was a typical marinara and the cheese melted perfectly. The toppings included pepperoni, sausage, ham, salami, and bacon and were dispersed just right. The IPA I had with it was just some sugar on top. I ended up eating about 4 slices so I had a ton of leftovers.

To me, [750 Grill](http://750grill.com/) would be a great spot to hit after golfing or if you live remotely close to it. I can’t attest to the taco pizza but the meatsa is one I highly suggest. The place also has a pretty cool bar with a bunch of TV’s so sitting watching a game with some pizza would be a great idea. And hell, if you’re an early riser, like I mentioned above, they even have breakfast.

Final Rating: 3 slices
