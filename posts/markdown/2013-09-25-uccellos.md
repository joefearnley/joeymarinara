It’s hard to believe it has been a year since Zig was born. The years get faster and faster and this past one is a true sign of that. For the little guy’s birthday Ray brought him to Grand Rapids so we could have lunch together. Their plan was to hit the Grandville mall afterward so I suggested some places near there.

After hearing nothing but good things about it, I decided on [Uccello’s](http://www.uccellos.com/). They offer a lunch buffet on Friday’s (maybe other days too, I’m not sure). I met up with the others around noon at the Grandville location, near the mall, and grabbed a table.

The waiter mentioned they offer a lunch buffet that included pizza, pasta, salad, soup and prime rib. I could always order off the menu but I was basically there for pizza and I know the group wouldn’t be able to decide on anything. So I went with the buffet.

My first trip up I went with a salad and a little pasta to test the waters. It wasn’t bad and the buffet area wasn’t that busy. My second trip up I grabbed a couple slices of pepperoni and hunk of the stuffed pie (or maybe it was a calzone, I’m not sure). At this point, the buffet was filling up with people.

I wasn’t really blown away by my bit few bites. I’ve noticed at a few pizza buffets, they cut the pies into really thin slices. This doesn’t do it for me. I fell like it takes away from the pie a little bit. Regardless, it was good. I especially liked the stuffed pie. It was crispy the cheese was melted nicely, oozing out the sides. I don’t recall what exactly was inside. I know for sure there was pepperoni and ham that added a nice salty punch.

Finally, stuffed, I still managed to drive in a couple slices of prime rib. In the ended I think I had at least four slices of pizza (two pepperoni, two ham and bacon), two hunks of the stuffed pie along with a salad.

I’d suggest everyone check out Uccello’s, at least for their lunch buffet. Buffet’s are a little dangerous so I try to stay away from them as much as I can. But this one was good. And they offered prime rib sliced for you on the spot. I think next time I’ll go for dinner and check out what other options they have for pizza.

Final Rating: 3 Slices
