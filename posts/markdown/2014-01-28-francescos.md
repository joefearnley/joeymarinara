It is my second to last day here at my current gig and I am taking a last chance effort to find some pizza joints around the area. I’ve tried about everything I could so I started to venture out into surrounding areas. Grandville is nearby and it has a few different places that peaked my interest. After researching for a few minutes I decided on Francesco’s.

Francesco’s is located on the northeast side of Grandville. When going through Grandville I am usually passing through the downtown area on my way home from work or the area around the mall, so this area in unknown to me. It’s a little industrial and a little sparse so this place was not hard to find. After about 10 minutes of driving and missing a turn, I eventually found it.

Francesco’s is your typical mom and pop pizza joint. When you walk in there is a counter that you order at, a station with red pepper, parmesan, napkins, and a few places to sit down. I ordered up a slice of pepperoni and pepperoni/sausage which, as a deal, came with a small fountain soda. I filled up my cup, sprinkled a dusting of red pep and parm on the slices, and found a seat.

The first bite of the pepperoni was very good. It was fresh with the cheese melted nicely and the pepperoni a little crispy, but not burnt. The crust was thin and crispy but had a hint of doughiness to it.

All in all, Fransesco’s hit the spot. I think my total was somewhere around $5 for a couple of slices and a soda. That’s certainly enough for me. The service was friendly and fast. They also offered a variety of subs if that’s your bag. If you ever find yourself in that part of Grandville or that end of 28th St., I would suggest stopping into Fransesco’s for a slice.

Final Rating: 3 slices
