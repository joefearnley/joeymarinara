On the second leg of my summer trip out west was few days in Las Vegas. This time a good friend of mine was getting married and bunch of others we coming out to join the fun. Our original plan was to drive from Los Angeles to Vegas to experience the ultimate road trip. We then realized it was a holiday weekend and the cost to fly there was under $100 a person. So it was back to the airport for a quick jaunt to Vegas (which was on another Virgin flight and they gave us free beer!).

The first night there was a little hazy. I won’t go into detail about it but needless to say we had a good time. We actually talked about maybe finding a pizza place for dinner but it didn’t work out that way. Day two was the pool day. Having no recollection of eating dinner the night before I woke up starving. We headed down to the pool and made a pit stop at [Bonanno’s](http://www.bonannosnewyorkpizzeria.com/) for a slice. It’s a small chain that offers New York style slices in the food courts of a few resorts on the Vegas strip. They had a nice selection of pies and the slices were huge. I ordered a couple of pepperonis and we head out to the pool.

As we approached the entrance of the pool, I got an odd look from the security guard. He told me I couldn’t bring in the pizza with me and Rachel didn’t want to go back into the hotel to eat so my only option was to drive as much of the pizza as I could. I got through most of the first one and had to pitch pretty much the second one. It was a bummer but enough to fill me up for a while. I also didn’t get a picture of the slices because I didn’t bring my camera to the pool. Luckily for me it wouldn’t be my last stop there that day.

After a day at the pool, the night time entertainment was the Cirque du Soleil’s rendition of The Beatles at The Mirage. Which was cool but I’m not a big Beatles fan and was a little exhausted Afterward we attempted to find a steak house for dinner but the few we tried were closed. Our best bet was back to the food court at the hotel. And of course, I ordered more pizza.

This time around I opted for mushroom which isn’t ever my first choice but the were in some sort of transition at the moment and it was all that was available that looked tempted. I ordered a slice and beer and we headed to find a seat. The slice was greasy with nice crust and of course, huge. I even folder it in half to get the most of the New York slice experience. I gotta say though, with a slice this size and only one topping, I was a bit overwhelmed with mushroom about half way through.

I eventually finished the slice. One slice of this stuff is about all you need. I was full and ready for bed. Unfortunately I didn’t get to [eat any underwater](http://joeymarinara.com/post/29171446910/pool-side-pizza-at-the-flamingo) this time around but I’ll be alright. Next time I’m in Vegas I’ll have to check out another joint. Bonanno’s was conveniently located in the hotel which was nice. It’s not the pizza capital of the west side of the country by any means but I did see there was plenty of other options. It’s just tough to get around in Vegas. Next time I’ll make it a priority.

Final Rating: 3 slices
