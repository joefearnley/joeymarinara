Oh [Main St. Pub](http://www.mainstpub.com), how I loathe you but for some reason keep coming back. This place has turned into the second default Rachel and I end up at when we can’t think of any other place to eat. I once again agreed to go and figuring some food is better than no food. Although in this case it might have been a better idea to stay in.

My problem with Main St. is that it’s pretty much a bar with drink specials and all but then they try to cater to those folks who prefer a home-cooked meal. It reminds me of the local restaurants I went to growing up. If you want a home-cooked meal why don’t you just stay home? And don’t get me started on the staff…actually the staff is pretty good. They do insist on rattling off the three dinner specials for you even though they are written on the board outside and it always hurts because you can tell they don’t have that shit memorized. Let’s not digress.

As always I can’t decide what to order. Nothing was sounding good that night. They offer a 9", thin crust pizza for six bucks so I figured I couldn’t go wrong. Oh but was I. It was like Brewster’s all over again. I was a little confused when they brought it, I though I ordered ham and pepperoni. I mean it could resemble ham, you be the judge.

I did finish the whole thing like a big boy but it left my buds as confused as my mind. This makes me think places like this put pizza on the menu just to have it on there. Is for the kids? If so then leave the kids at home. Is it to round out the menu? If this is the case then drop it because it’s round enough. There’s meatloaf on there for christ’s sake.

If you ever do end up at Main St. take my advice: try the Beer of the Month and don’t order the pizza.
