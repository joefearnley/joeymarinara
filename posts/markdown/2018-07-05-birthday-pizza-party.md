It’s another year down for me this summer as I turned the big 3 6. It is by no means a milestone year but it’s summertime and people are usually up for a party. Ray mentioned having a keg party for my birthday this year. It was probably in passing but I took it and ran with it. I ordered a keg to be picked that day but we still need to decide what we wanted to do for food. Everyone who I ran is passed pretty much said the same thing: pizza.

We milled around the idea for a couple of weeks. Some other ideas were brisket or pulled pork – some sort of barbeque. I ran it by a couple of my friends and my buddy Dave came up with one of the best ideas I’ve heard in a long time: BYOP - Bring Your Own Pizza. I ran it by Ray and she loved it. I posted to the event page telling everyone to bring a pie and it was on.

The day of the party finally came. The keg was on ice and patio was cleaned. After the first couple of people showed up I began to realize that we were going to have a lot of pizza. I was just hoping everyone would come hungry.

In the end, everyone came through with a variety of pizza. We had pies from Marine Tap Room, The Mitten Brewing, Rebel Pies, Speedway, Greek Tony’s, Village Baker, Mama Mia’s, Glenside Pub, Pizza Hut, Papa Murphy’s, Lombardo’s, and event some frozen ones. Everyone including myself were filled to the gills with pizza. The party went until the wee hours of the morning and I spent the next week trying to finish off the keg and leftover pizza. I didn’t have any luck with the keg and had to throw out the remaining pizza once magnets were discovered on one of the pies. After trying most of the pizza I have to say Lombardo’s was probably my favorite.

Final Rating: 3 slices
