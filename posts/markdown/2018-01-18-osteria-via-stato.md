So we decided to stay a second night in Chicago. After hitting the Museum of Science and Industry for a day, no one felt like driving home. Once we got back to the hotel we got some naps in and had to figure out what to eat for dinner. Staying right in the middle of downtown we had plenty of options, but didn’t want to have to walk that far because it was only 8 degrees and extremely windy out.

After not really coming to a conclusion and realizing there was restaurant/pizza place just off the hotel lobby named [Pizzeria Via Stato](http://osteriaviastato.com/pizzeria/), we decided put in an order for a couple of pies. They offered what they call tavern pizza which is around 10-12 inches. The guy taking the order suggested getting a couple of them because the size.

20 minutes later I headed down to the lobby, into the restaurant, pass the bar, and down a hallway to the end of the hall where there was this half door thing. After waiting a couple of minutes, a guy popped his head out, took my name, and came back with the pizza. I paid him and headed back up the room.

Once we got the pizzas open, I noticed something I hadn’t seen before. The boxes actually doubled as plates. Interesting concept. Regardless I grabbed a couple of slices. They were cut small, in 3-inched squares. The crust was thin, crispy, and flowery. The pepperonis were really small, spicy, and a little crunchy. There was not much cheese or sauce on these slices but I think that is the style they were going for. The whole package had a sweet and spicy taste to it which was really good.

[Pizzeria Via Stato](http://osteriaviastato.com/pizzeria/) was a nice way to cap our Saturday night in Chicago. Looking back on [Pizzeria Via Stato](http://osteriaviastato.com/pizzeria/), I probably would have gotten a little crazier with the pizza order. I think these kind of pies call for more than pepperoni. All in all though, I think it was a good choice. We ended up seeing dinosaurs the next day and made it home with a couple more days off before work.

Final Rating: 3 slices
