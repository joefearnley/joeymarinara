I had a chance to hit the town for bit recently in Kalamazoo and was checking out my options. Earlier in the month I saw that Mustard Plug was playing in town that night with some other ska band from Chicago opening along with Chad’s soul group. The last few times in town they have played at [The Strutt](http://joeymarinara.com/post/7785392905/the-strutt) which is gone now and I thought I remember reading that it was at Louie’s which is always a good time. Upon further investigation I saw that the show had been changed to [the 411 Club](http://www.the411club.com/). I had no idea where this place was but soon realized it was in the same building as [The Metro](http://www.the411club.com/nightclub/). I waited until the right time and headed toward downtown.

I’d actually been to The Metro a couple of times before and had no idea that the area where the 411 club even existed. I mean it would’ve had to. It didn’t look like a this area was new at all. Regardless, having been here before I remember there was a diner area in the back that I always wanted to check out. It seems this has since moved into it’s own area but you can order food anywhere in the building from it.

When I walked in the club Chad’s band was playing and I immediately ran into some people I knew and they invited me to the booth they were sitting in. They informed me that they special tonight was $1 Old Style cans so I ordered a few of them up. After a while the band had finished up and a pizza was delivered to the table. I wasn’t necessarily hungry but they offered my a slice. I initially declined the offer but after catching a smell of the pie I decided to take a slice.

The pizza itself was pretty good. It had a thin crust and a lot of cheese. I didn’t order the pizza so I wasn’t exactly sure what was on it. Maybe pepperoni and some sort of sausage? Things got a little fuzzy after a few Old Styles and even though I took a picture it is still hard to tell. I know that after eating dinner earlier and having only one slice I certainly could have gone for more. That has to say something.

I can’t say that pizza would be the first thing I would order from Metro Diner. Unfortunately I didn’t see a menu while I was there so I can’t say if anything else there sounded appealing. I can say that the venue was pretty cool and it is always good to have more of those around town. As more close down a few tend to pop up. Let’s hope we can eventually balance things out.

Final Rating: 3 slices
