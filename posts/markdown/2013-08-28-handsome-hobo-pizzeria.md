Well I am officially 31 years old and it doesn’t fell too bad. Ask me again in another 5 years and I might have a different outlook on things but for now I’m good. And in leu of this milestone my parents wanted to take me out to eat. Since we were out of town in on my official birthday and I live in a different town than my folks, it had to wait a month.

As always, it was up to me to choose where we would go. I never really like doing this because I always feel like I am getting judged in a way. I’m not sure why. That and I never really care. Like always, pizza sounded good, I was in Muskegon and I’d heard of a new(ish) pizza place that had opened in the north part of town. [Handsome Hobo’s](https://www.handsomehobopizzeria.com/) is the name of the place. I suggested it, everyone agreed and that was that.

The name of this place may sound familiar. It was opened by the same group who opened [Handsome Henry’s](http://joeymarinara.com/post/16193571936/handsome-henrys-deep-dish) on the other side of town. It’s a little different in that it specializes in pizzas. They also offer pasta dishes, salads and soups. We met my parents in the parking lot and went in and grabbed a booth.

After briefly taking a peak at their website before dinner I pretty much knew what I wanted by the time we ordered. I got a Chicago deep dish with pepperoni and black olive. All the deep dish pies come in a 10 inch size and you can order it however you want.

After about 20 minutes the pizza came out smelling absolutely great. I dug out a slice and went to town. It was warm, buttery and full of cheese. The sauce was kind of sweet and topped off with a sprinkle of seasoning and a little parmesan. I couldn’t help think of how much it reminded me of Handsome Henry’s because well, I’m pretty sure it was the same pizza. But this wasn’t a bad thing at all. In the end I took down two slices and was stuffed.

Not only was this a great birthday dinner but it was also the first time my son has tried pizza. A milestone in everyones life. It’s located a little out of the way from most areas of Muskegon but if you ever find yourself in the northern section and are looking for a great meal I’d suggest checking Handsome Hobo’s out. If pizza or pasta’s not your bag you can go across the parking lot to Hobo’s and get a burger. I’ve had one of them and highly recommend it.
