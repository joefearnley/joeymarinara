I’ve never thought about becoming a teacher. It’s probably a good thing I didn’t because I am not very good at explaining things and am a total pushover. It’s days like these though (and I don’t think I’m alone here) where I kind of wish I had. It’s the middle of the summer, the sun is shining, it’s warm out and I’m stuck here in an office with long pants and a collared shirt on. Something tells me though, at this point in my life, I wouldn’t be sitting around doing nothing even if I had my summers off.

Most days like this should be spent inside because once you go out there and get a taste of what you are missing, a little bit of depression starts to kick in and it’s a bit difficult to get focused again. For me, on this particular day, that was my lunch break. Once the time rolled around I started thinking about where I wanted to go. After seeing multiple billboards around the area advertising it I set my sights on [Craig’s Cruisers](http://www.craigscruisers.com/).

I know, it’s a little ridiculous, but if you put pizza on a billboard you immediately have my attention. And the fact that there is one right down the road from my office I figured I should at least give it a try. They offer a lunch buffet with pizza, pasta, salad and desserts. I had this fantasy in my head where, because it was the middle of the week and the middle of the day, I would practically have the place to myself. It never dawned on my that children don’t go to school in the summer and how many of them visit places like this on a daily basis.

As I entered I soon realized how crazy it gets in a place like this. I’d been to Chuck E Cheese on a Saturday for a birthday party but it was nothing like this. I approached the counter to pay for my buffet. The girl there asked me if I wanted to get a wristband. She explained to me it was Wristband Wednesday and for $20 I could ride all of the rides and play a bunch of games for 3 hours. It was tempting but I opted for only the lunch buffet and headed over to the food court.

Man was it busy. There were kids everywhere. Big kids, small kids, handicap kids…I sort of had to constantly be aware of my surroundings in fear of getting taken out by one. I did a once over with the food and decided to start with a salad. It was pretty simple, I added some bacon, cheese, pepperoni and black olives to the lettuce and topped it off with a little ranch. It was your run-of-the-mill salad that wasn’t bad and I polished off pretty quickly. Then I headed to the pizza line.

My first time up, things were a little slow moving. Some people were waiting for more pies to come out. I ended up grabbing a slice of pepperoni and the last slice of buffalo chicken. I didn’t care much for the pepperoni. It was a little deformed and the crust was too thick and way too chewy. The buffalo chicken on the other hand was pretty good. Even though it was the last slice on the pan, it was still warm and tasty. The chicken was a little tough and I probably could have done without it. All in all it was a good slice.

On my last trip up I opted for a slice of pepperoni, sausage and bacon along with a couple of breadsticks. Even though I’m not really a fan of sausage this was probably my favorite slice. The good thing about it being busy was the pizza didn’t sit out for more than a few minutes. It was warm and cheesy. With the meats mixed in added a nice salty punch that sealed the deal for me. While not bad, the breadsticks could have used a little more butter. These mixed with a little marinara was a great addition to the slice.

The one word of advice I have for going to the lunch buffet at [Craig’s Cruisers](http://www.craigscruisers.com/) would be to pick any day other than Wednesday. Also, the buffet is open during lunch on select days in the spring and fall while the kids are in school, which would have been made things a little easier for me. And kids, if there is one thing I have learned today it’s you don’t know what you have until that shit’s gone. Including summer. So take advantage.
