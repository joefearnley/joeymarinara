I rarely post about pizza joint chains but I’ve been on a diet since the beginning of the year and I am trying to fill in the gaps. This past weekend we ordered [Jet’s](http://jetspizza.com) for dinner. I got a real hankering for a big, New York style slice after watching [The Pizza Show](https://video.vice.com/en_us/show/pizza-show%E2%80%9D) and it turns out that is fairly uncommon around my parts. I remembered seeing an ad for [Jet’s](http://jetspizza.com) version of this which they call [The Bold Fold](#%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaYanf1Cdo4%E2%80%9D). The ad looked delicious so I ordered one for pickup.

About 30 minutes later I got it home and popped the box open. I have to be honest, the picture was pretty deceiving. The actual pizza was soaked with grease, which is fine for the taste, but at some point it started to turn the cheese a different color. Needless to say it was a bit unappetizing.

That didn’t stop me from eating it though. The crust was really thin almost to the point where, when I picked a slice up, it flopped right over. Like I mentioned above, the pizza was super greasy which I thought made it good. There was little sauce on the pie but I think that comes with the territory. I also ordered the Turbo Crust which is a combination of spices and sauces that they put on the crust to give it some flavor. After dipping this in the side of marinara I realized this was an excellent choice.

This was the first time I tried [The Bold Fold](#%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaYanf1Cdo4%E2%80%9D) and I’m not sure if I am going to again. [Jet’s](http://jetspizza.com) is known for its 8-corner thick crust pie and if you’re getting Jet’s, so next time I am going to stick with that. I am not sure if you can with the 8-corner but if you can I would suggest going with the Turbo Crust, you will not be disappointed with that.

Final Rating: 2 slices
