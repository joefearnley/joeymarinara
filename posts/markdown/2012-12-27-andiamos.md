As the year is winding down and the holidays are among us my last couple of weeks at work have been short and a bit scattered. I was going back and forth between Kalamazoo, Muskegon and Grand Rapids so I didn’t have much time to prepare lunch for work. I had to go back the day after Christmas and forgot to bring some leftovers with me. Lunchtime came and I was hungry. For some reason Chinese food was sounding really good but I soon came to the conclusion that I shouldn’t be wasting times like this on anything but pizza. Especially if I have any thought of going on a diet come the first of the year.

I started looking at my options. Now that my office is on the other side of the highway I started venturing into south west side of Grand Rapids and noticed a few places that I hadn’t before. Again the first choices for me are the ones that offer either pizza by the slice or a buffet. I finally decided on a place called Andiamo’s. It was only 5-10 minutes from my office and offered a lunch buffet consisting of pizza, breadsticks, stromboli and salad for $5. Off to Grandville I went.

The place is located in a strip mall with a gym and upscale liquor store next to it. It’s in an area of town I’ve never been to before that basically consists of a lot of housing development. I guess that would explain why I’d never been there before. As I entered the place I immediately noticed that it was small and basically empty. Granted it was the day after Christmas but that could got either way. I also noticed how tiny the buffet area was. The combination of these two things made me a little weary. Regardless, I ordered the buffet, grabbed a slice of pepperoni, a breadstick, a slice of the stromboli and found a seat.

Buffets during lunch time are always a crap shoot. Unless you take your time with them, odds are you are going to miss out on the good pizza. It also depends on how busy it is. That could also work against you because if you don’t show up at the start of it and the no one else shows up, the pizza sits out and starts to go a little bad. This is what happened in my case. They had two full pies sitting out that looked like they hadn’t been touched in about an hour. One was pepperoni and the other ham, pepperoni and bacon. The stomboli on the other hand tasted fresh and was very good. It was warm and cheesy which totally hit the spot.

On my second trip up I grabbed a slice of each of the pizzas, another piece of the stromboli and a salad. The salad bar was pretty disappointing. I didn’t even notice it the first time I went up to the buffet. They offered lettuce, a few toppings and dressing you have to apply with a squeeze bottle. They did have pepperoni as an option for a topping which I thought was a nice touch. Again the pizza had been sitting out way too long and being a guy who will eat pizza at any temperature this stuff just did not hold up. The toppings were hardened, the cheese all congealed and the crust just a bit too though.

All in all, my trip to Andiamo’s wasn’t that bad although with all of the other options around the area I don’t see myself going back. There was nothing there I can’t find better somewhere else besides maybe the price. For the buffet and a drink my total was just over $6. If you like becoming a regular somewhere (which they seem to like based on the conversations between the employees and another customer) or live near in the area, I’d check out Andiamo’s. Otherwise I’d ventured further back into civilization where you’ll find much better options.

Final Rating: 3 Slices
