As [previously](http://joeymarinara.com/post/179217132129/basil-leaf-pizza) [mentioned,](http://joeymarinara.com/post/179217226129/eat-n-out) I attended a conference over the last weekend that was full of tech and pizza. On the second day lunch was catered but I wanted slip in one more pizza place. I mentioned it before but when I first did a run through the casino when I got there on Thursday night, I saw a place selling pizza and sandwiches. I wanted a bit of a break from conference rooms for a while so I headed out to the casino when lunch time came.

The place was called [Stack’d](https://www.greektowncasino.com/restaurants/stackd-restaurant/) and was located in the Greektown casino. They offer pizza, sandwiches, salads, and a handful of appetizers. There were a few different pizzas in the hopper. After a short debate in my brain on whether to get the meat lovers or just pepperoni I decided on the pepperoni to keep things consistent. I grabbed a beer at the bar and sat down to eat.

The pizza has a nice thick crust on it. The cheese was plentiful tasted pretty fresh with the pepperoni complementing it nicely. Honestly there was nothing special to this pizza, seemed a bit on the cheap end of the pizza spectrum. At the time, though, the slice combined with the cold beer was exactly what I was looking for.

I wouldn’t tell anyone [Stack’d](https://www.greektowncasino.com/restaurants/stackd-restaurant/) is the first stop for food you should make in Greektown by any means. I feel like it’s more of a last resort or even a snack option. That or if you want to tank a cigarette while you eat dinner this would probably be the place for you. Smoked-filled ambiance aside, I have to hand it to the place, they makes a pretty good pie.

Final Rating: 3 slices
