A couple of months ago I started a new job down in Holland, MI. Since starting my coworker and pal [Jeff](http://%E2%80%9D) has been bugging me to join him for lunch at a local pizza place named [Crust 54](http://%E2%80%9D). He finally caught me on a day I didn’t bring lunch so I decided to join him.

[Crust 54](http://%E2%80%9D) is located in Holland, MI. They a location downtown (the original) and one on the south side of town (which is the one we chose because it is closer to our office). They offer three kinds of pizza: Chicago Style Deep Dish, Stone-fired Thin, and Gluten Free. During lunch they have a special where you can get a single slice of the Chicago style or two slices of the stone-fired thin for $6 with a drink. When we arrived they only had one slice of the Chicago style (with a new one not coming out for 20 minutes) and a fresh stone-fired thin. The deep dish was the Carnivore, which is basically a meat lovers, and the thin crust was pepperoni. Jeff and I decided to order two lunch specials, one a deep dish slice and the other two thin crust and split them.

After paying the cashier, we got our drinks and grabbed a seat. I tried the deep dish first. The first thing that stuck out to me (which always does with Chicago style) was the sauce. It had a little spiciness to it and was a bit sweet. The meat, which included pepperoni, sausage, ham, and bacon, mix with some awesome mozzarella cheese added some great flavor.

The thin crust slice was also great. The pizza was fresh out of the oven when were ordered so it was hot and fresh. The pepperoni and melted cheese combination created salty, greasy flavor that I could have eaten plenty more of. For me, either the one slice of deep dish or two slices of thin crust would have been plenty for lunch.

[Crust 54](http://%E2%80%9D) also offers salads and a handful of appetizers but pizza is their main gig. With the exception of Giordano’s recently opening up shop in town, you’d be hard pressed to find authentic Chicago style pizza like [Crust 54](http://%E2%80%9D) serves in town or even the area. I’ve heard the wait time for a pie at Giordano’s at dinner time is something like 4 hours, so save yourself some time and money and hit up [Crust 54](http://%E2%80%9D) instead. You will not be disappointed.

Final Rating: 4 slices
