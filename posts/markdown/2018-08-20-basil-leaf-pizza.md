Last weekend I attended a conference in Detroit. It started bright and early on Friday morning so I drive down Thursday night to stay the night so I was ready to go in the morning. The conference was at Greektown Casino in the downtown Detroit where I was staying as well. Once I got settled in my swanky digs on the 19th floor overlooking the city I started looking for places to go for dinner.

Greektown Casino is located the in the main part of the Greektown neighborhood of Detroit which is basically a two-block strip of bars and restaurants, most of which is surrounded by the casino. I was on the search for pizza and had couple of options. After a beer and stroll through the casino I decided on [Monroe Market](https://www.greektowncasino.com/restaurants/monroe-market/) which is actually located in the casino. It is a food-court style place with a bunch of different options including burgers, barbeque, Mexican, fried chicken, pizza, and a bakery. All of the food looked good but I ultimately landed on [Basil Leaf Pizza](https://www.greektowncasino.com/restaurants/monroe-market/basil-leaf-menu/).

[Basil Leaf’s](https://www.greektowncasino.com/restaurants/monroe-market/basil-leaf-menu/) menu is pretty basic. They have about six different pizzas to offer as well a couple of salads and a couple of sandwiches. I opted for the “Meat" which comes with pepperoni, sausage, ham, bacon, and mozzarella on it. All of the ordering and payment for food in the market is done through a kiosk which was a first for me. I tried to opt of the sausage but it ended up making on to the pizza anyway. It is hard toΩ know who to blame for that one. About 10 minutes later the pizza came out. I found a seat and dug in.

The pizza was basically wood-fired. The crust thin and more on the chewy side than crispy but still had some parts on the ends with some crunch. All of the meat was cut into some pretty thick slices including the pepperoni. Like mentioned, I tried to order it without sausage but it still came with it on and was pretty abundant. The bacon was a little on the fatty side but the pepperoni was great. I ate about half of it before I threw in the towel. I boxed the rest up for a late-night snack.

[Basil Leaf Pizza](https://www.greektowncasino.com/restaurants/monroe-market/basil-leaf-menu/) was pretty satisfying. Unfortunately they got my order wrong and I forgot to print my receipt and couldn’t figure out how to do so after so I couldn’t expense it. I think my total was around $10 so it was the end of the world. I also lost a few dollars in the slot machines but that was expected. The smoking in the casino threw me for a loop. At least I had something to munch on later.

Final Rating: 3 slices
