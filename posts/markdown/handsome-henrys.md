Lunch with my dad has become some sort of ritual whenever I am in Muskegon. Between that and golf, there does exist things we actually have in common. This particular Saturday I was freed up and we decided to hit up the newly-opened Handsome Henry’s. Located in the building that used to be Finley’s on Henry St., it’s a bit more of an upscale joint with a nice bar that is pretty much the first thing you see as you enter. Big Joe and myself decide to belly up.

The choices for pizza were abundant. Big Joe wanted a burger so I was on my own. I ordered the personal and it came fresh out of the oven with bacon and pepperoni. The crust was thin so I ate pretty much most of it. Sauce was good and the cheese…well…it left a little something to be desired.

I do have to say that all in all it was very good. Even better along with a cold Oberon. There was an option for deep dish and chicago style, but rolling solo I was limited on what I could order. Any restaurant can throw pizza on the menu and get a few biters, but this place was a step right above that. Next time, I plan to go bigger. 

Final Rating: 3 slices
