Friday night is a perfect night for pizza. I actually stayed in Kalamazoo the entire weekend for the first time in a while so I decided see what my options were around town. I remembered during the chili cook-off there was a newer place downtown called [Big Joe’s](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Big-Joes-Pizza-Deli/306072121722). I wasn’t a big fan of the chili they made but though I would give the pizza a try. I ordered up a large pepperoni and some breadsticks. Ten minutes to pick up.

When I lived downtown I ate at the place that occupied Big Joe’s previously a few times. On Saturdays I would order up a calzone, stop at the cigar shop for some beers on the walk to pick it up and head back to my apartment to eat it. I remember the place had an abnormally large seating area for what it was and was always empty. Well, on Friday nights it’s not much different. While paying for my pizza I asked the guy how the business was on the weekends. He said it pretty slow but they make up for it during the week with lunch time.

I got the pizza home and popped open the box. The slices were a bit on the thick side. The sauce was tasty but I wasn’t too keen on the cheese. I don’t know what it was. I am usually a fan of any cheese but something about this stuff just didn’t taste right. I wouldn’t say it was bad it just wasn’t would it could (at least in my opinion). After a couple of slices and a couple of bread sticks I was pretty full and certainly satisfied.

I am not sure if I would get the pizza from Big Joe’s again. I know it’s not worth a shit in the morning so only order what you think you are going to eat. I would like to try the sandwiches some time. I can’t seem to find a menu anywhere online but from what I remember when I was in there they had a lot of options.

Final Rating: 3 slices
