Like I mentioned in an earlier post, I had to go to Canada for work. Specifically the Toronto area. I’d only been to Canada a couple times before this. Once was to Sault St. Marie to play a peewee hockey tournament and the other was to Windsor when I was 19 to drink legally. So needless to say it’s been a while. I had my passport and a company letter to get me in so a coworker and I made the 6 hour trek to a suburb of Toronto called Brampton.

One thing I noticed during the commute from the hotel to the office we were working at every morning was there was no shortage of restaurants in the area. Especially chains (most of which I’d never heard) including Tim Horton’s (driving down the road there was literally one every two minutes). And when working for a food service company, one thing you never miss is a meal, especially when they are paying. So one of the days we decided to head out for lunch to a place called [Boston Pizza](http://bostonpizza.com/).

[Boston Pizza](http://bostonpizza.com/) was your typically chain restaurant. If I had to compare it to a place in the states I would say it probably could have been an Old Chicago. We decided to dine in the bar area where they had the Tigers playing the Blue Jays on full blast. They had pretty big menu with a variety of lunch specials which included one that caught my eye. For $7 you get a two-topping small pizza with a side salad of your choice. I order that with pepperoni and black olives for my toppings and a side Cesar salad.

About 20 minutes later the waitress brought the pizza out and I dug in. It was right out of the oven with the cheese nicely melted on a soft (but not too soft) buttery crust. The sauce was not as sweet as I would have liked but tasty nonetheless. I felt like they put a few too many olives on it but other than that it tasted excellent. The pizza combined with the side salad was a perfect amount of food for lunch.

Even though it is a national chain, I thought the food at Boston Pizza was great. The thing that bummed me out a bit was the fact that we had to go back to the office otherwise I totally would have ordered some of the Stella they had on tap and watched the rest of the baseball game. They also had this amazing looking thing called the [pizzaburger](http://media.bostonpizza.com/pizzaburger/) that I almost ordered but it looked like a bit too much for a light lunch. If you ever get the chance I would check out Boston Pizza. They have a pretty diverse menu in case pizza isn’t your thing so you are sure to find something to tickle your fancy.
