Last Saturday night was a fun one. Earlier in the week I wasn’t planning on doing much, but a coworker of mine asked me if I want interested in purchasing his tickets to the [Descendants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descendents) show on this weekend at a very discounted price. As I already had a couple of friends going to the show I took him up on the offer.

The show was at [20 Monroe Live](http://www.20monroelive.com/), a new(ish) venue in downtown Grand Rapids. It was my first time there and was pretty impressed with the place. The show was great as well. We missed the first band and by the time we got there Mustard Plug was just starting. Then the Descendents played and rocked the house for well over an hour playing all the hits.

When the show got out the decision was to make a stop before heading home. I suggested [The Knickerbocker](http://newhollandbrew.com/knickerbocker/) as I’ve never been, so we swung in to check the place out. After getting no service and ready to be on our way home, Adam suggested to grab a slice of pizza next door at a place named [Fratelli’s](http://www.fratellispizzagr.com/). There was no need to twist my arm on this one, I was all for it.

[Fratelli’s](http://www.fratellispizzagr.com/) is a small place on Bridge Street. They offer much more than pizza but that was all that was on my mind at the time. The inside is very simple. Just a counter and a couple of places to eat on a stools along the sides. Next to the counter there were a couple of glass cases with all of the pizza-by-the-slice offerings being kept warm. I ended up choosing a meat heavy slice with ham, bacon, and sausage on it. We headed back to Adam’s place to eat.

The slices were still warm when we got back and I dove right in. The slices were a good size and covered with toppings with plenty of cheese. The crust was still a bit flowery on the bottom and didn’t have much of a crunch. The sauce was a little on the pasty side but a bit sweet and very good. The mixture of the different meats and cheese was great.

I can only imagine what kind of business [Fratelli’s](http://www.fratellispizzagr.com/) gets on any given Saturday night. The place was pretty crowded. The are open pretty late so if you are looking for that late night snack or want to soak up some of that booze, I’d suggest checking them out. They also deliver, so even it if is a chill Friday night, give [Fratelli’s](http://www.fratellispizzagr.com/) a call and get that pie. You will not be disappointed.

Final Rating: 4 slices
