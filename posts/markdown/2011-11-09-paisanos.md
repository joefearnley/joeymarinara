Another Friday was up and another decision was to be made as to where to go to lunch. I actually wasn’t originally planning on going out for lunch as I had an extra half of a sub in the fridge ready to go but I was feeling a little cooped up in the office so I figured some fresh air and non-work conversation would help. We decided on [Paisano’s](http://paisanosbarandgrill.com/) and off we went.

Paisano’s is an alright joint. It’s kind of a bar and grille with an Italian name. Which makes it sort of feel like an Italian joint even though it isn’t. I’ve only been there for the occasional lunch and a couple times after work to catch happy hour. I imagine though it gets pretty jumpin’ come ten o'clock on a Saturday night. Especially with the limitation on night life in Three Rivers.

The menu contains everything from appetizers to pizza and pasta to salads to burgers. And still for some reason I still look at this place as Italian. Regardless I usually get one of the sub sandwiches but today I opted for the pizza. They offered a few different options for specialties but I stuck with the pepperoni and cheese and ordered up a twelve-incher for myself.

The pizza came out hot and fresh. I soon realized that the 8 inch option might have been a wiser choice. I was pleasantly surprised by the party cut and a party it was. The pie had a lot of fluff to it reminding me very much of [Bilbo’s pan version](http://joeymarinara.com/post/11597054151/bilbos-pan) The cheese was piled high but I felt like something was uneven about it. Like it was cooked more in some part than others. Not to say the taste was bad because it wasn’t. It just seemed like it could have been tightened up a little bit.

All in all, I thought the pizza landed somewhere in the middle. I was only able to finish half of it before I had to throw in the towel. I can’t say it’s a must for ordering it you ever make it to Paisano’s. I’d stick with one of the sandwiches or wraps. But if your are with a group and feel like pizza, I’d say go for it maybe try out one of the specialties. If your any sort of connoisseur, the pepperoni probably won’t do it for you it.

Final Rating: 3 slices
