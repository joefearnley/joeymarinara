It’s that time of year again. I am rounding out my twenties by taking a trip with a few pals of mine to Las Vegas. Dave, Jason and I we leaving from Grand Rapids to meet a couple of others that were already there. I had the afternoon off of work so that gave me a little time to pack and generally “gear up” for the flight. Once Rachel got out of work we headed north to the airport.

I guess it’s been a really long time since I’ve been in the Grand Rapids airport because for some reason I remember it being a lot bigger. After getting through security we made our way to the terminal only to wait another hour before boarding begins…you know the routine. Just as luck would have it though right by our terminal was a [Great American Bagel](http://www.greatamericanbagel.com/) with a bar next to it. I can’t imagine this was the same establishment because even though I think this was my first time visiting a Great American Bagel I’m pretty sure they don’t serve alcohol yet it was occupying the same space in the Airport. I guess it really doesn’t matter. Regardless we posted up and order some beers.

At this point in the evening I hadn’t eaten dinner yet and the beers were making me tipsy. The bagel joint had a variety of sandwiches including some sort of pizza/bagel/sandwich concoction. Dave and Jason suggested I try it out. According to the waitress they had on left so I ordered it up and went back to my seat.

This got me thinking. Since they only had one left means they either pre make them at the restaurant or they get shipped there that way? I don’t know if one is better than the other but I had to wonder why they didn’t just make it on the fly. A few minutes later out it came.

Once it came out I kind of starred at the thing for a moment, basically just trying to figure out what it was. Some sort of loaf of cheese-covered bread? I didn’t care. At this point I was a little drunk and was hungry. Once biting into it I realized it was basically a large bagel with some sort of cheese and a little marinara mixed in. Soft and very doughy. I would only get some marinara once I got to the middle of the thing. I wouldn’t say it was the worst thing I’ve tasted, but it wasn’t very good. Given the situation I was in I took what was available.

Ultimately our plane ended up getting delayed for three hours. Needless to say we were feeling pretty good by the time we got on board. And I know technically this place is a chain but I thought given the circumstances of where I was and being egged on I basically committed to this review. I don’t think I would ever visit this place for the pizza bagel but I would certainly give the breakfast a go. Maybe then my plan will be on time. This was going to be a fun trip.
