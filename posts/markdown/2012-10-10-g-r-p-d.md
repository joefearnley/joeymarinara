I was back in the studio again this week to try and finish up my bass parts. If all went as planned the instruments (beside some crazy horn arrangement Mario is trying to cook up for the reggae song) should be done. After that is vocals and we’ll damn near be done. If you have any interest in listening you can check out [the bandcamp page](http://protectedleft.bandcamp.com/).

[Like I mentioned before](http://joeymarinara.com/post/34911874879/brick-road-pizza), recording music works up an appetite so of course the the topic of dinner eventually came up. And of course, we the first on the list of options was pizza. Rick asked me if there were any pizza joints in Eastown I hadn’t tried before and I started to think. I’ve Brick Road, Gino’s, the Pizza Hut…that’s about all I could remember. Rick suggested G.R.P.D. I wasn’t really aware of the place other than the boxes I’ve seen lying around Banks Estate in the past. I thought it was a great idea so we ordered up a medium (or maybe it was a large, I can’t remember) pepperoni. After about 10 minutes of waiting the time had come so Rick and I headed up the the Pizza Department.

The place was located just down the road off Cherry St. next to a chinese joint. We walked inside to the counter to pay and the girl working gave us a coupon to use on the spot. The total ended up around $8 which we thought was a total steal. One thing I found amusing about this place is the coupon advertising they use (such campaigns include C.S.I \[cheese sauce ingredients\] and Pie vs Pie).

Once back in the we popped the box open and dug in. My favorite part of the pizza was the cheese. It was warm, flavorful and there was plenty of it. The crust was cooked to a point where it was crispy but not overdone. The sauce was typical marinara and not really sweet. That was alright with me though as the other ingredients combined with it made for a great pie. While we ate, Rick introduced me to a great pizza-related video that I’ll share for your viewing pleasure.

I’d definitely hit up G.R.P.D. again. I’d like to give the stuffed pizza or maybe the crusties ago next time. And I would find it difficult to beat the price we paid for this pie. If you find yourself at home with $8 to spare, I’d give this place a chance because they definitely deliver.
