This past week was [Coast Guard Festival in Grand Haven](http://www.coastguardfest.org/). For those of you who don’t know, Guard Festival is a week-long celebration of all things Coast Guard including a carnival, parade, an art fair, food, boat tours, parties, and fireworks. The city closes most of the roads off downtown for the carnival and vendors throughout the area.

Food vendors from all around West Michigan set up shop around downtown. For lunch options, this adds a whole new level as far as options are concerned. Over the course of the week I ate a Philly cheese steak, a Chicago-style hotdog, an elephant ear, and some pizza.

For the pizza, I choose a place called [Salvatore’s](http://%E2%80%9D) which was located across the street in the marina parking lot. [Salvatore’s](http://%E2%80%9D) actual restaurant is located in Grand Rapids on the West side of town in my buddy A.C.’s neighborhood. They are an Italian restaurant that offers pizza, subs, and Italian dinner dishes. For the Coast Guard Festival they offered pizza by the slice and breadsticks. I ordered a couple of pepperoni slices with a water and headed down by the channel to eat.

The pizza was quite fresh (which for a street vendor making pies on the spot, this could go either way). The crust was soft, a little thick, and had what tasted like some parmesan and/or spices on the edges. The pepperoni had a little spice to it and the cheese was plentiful and melted just right. I was skeptical if two slices was going to be enough for lunch but ended up being more than enough.

With all of the food options available at the Coast Guard festival (not to mention the number of restaurants surrounding the area), things can get overwhelming. A good chunk of the options are the carnival food truck basics, but you don’t have to look for to find other great spots. I’m hoping to get to [Salvatore’s](http://%E2%80%9D) actual location one of these days but until then they will most likely be in Grand Haven for a week at the end of July, so I can get my fix then.

Final Rating: 3 slices
