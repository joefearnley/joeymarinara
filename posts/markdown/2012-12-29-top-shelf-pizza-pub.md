I was back in Muskegon again right before the new year. I wanted to see if I could cram in some more pizza before the current year ended. Boy did I ever. It started last week and just kept rolling through the weekend. On Saturday I was scoping the prospects and eventually narrowed it down to [Top Shelf Pizza & Pub](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Top-Shelf-Pizza-Pub/113505982015945). We jumped in the car and headed out.

The main Top Shelf is located on Apple Ave. right near the area I used to hang for lunch while attending MCC (apparently there is now a second one located in Fruitport). I was telling Rachel I was pretty sure the place used to be Tony’s and knew exactly where it was located. Pulling up you could still see the faded old sign covered by a new one with from what I thought was a pretty cool logo - a martini glass stem with a slice of pizza on the top. The entrance was in the back which was a little confusing.

We walked in and grabbed a seat. The time was around noon and it being a Saturday I figured the place would be busy. Lone behold besides a couple of guys at the bar we were only ones there. Even though the place was empty it felt pretty cozy. The waitress came over and took our drink orders as we looked over the menu. They offer a nice choice of sub sandwiches including a gyro as well as pitas. I know what I wanted and ordered a medium pepperoni while Rachel order a small taco pizza.

The pizza came out fresh and smelling good. I wasted no time and dug right in. The crust was nice and crispy which was a nice touch with this type of pie. At first it was extremely hot and I actually burning my tongue a little bit but I was so hungry I powered through. It was the typical thinner-crusted pizza. The sauce was a bit on the sweeter side but nothing that made it really stand out.

At one point I tried a slice of the taco pie. When Rachel ordered it I gave her my two cents on how I felt about specialty pizzas like this one. I told her it was like going to a mexican restaurant and ordering a taco with pepperoni, marinara and mozzarella on it. Regardless specialty pizzas have their place and the taco pizza wasn’t bad. Rachel actually told me it was the best she’d ever had.

While we were eating I said to Rachel a couple of times that our waitress looked familiar. Turns out it was a friend of mine from high school’s mom. We had a short chat a caught up. It’s always nice to see people like that. If you are ever on Apple Ave. in Muskegon and are looking for a bite or just a beer stop into Top Shelf. If it’s a Saturday Bobbie will be working and she does a heck of a job.

Final Rating: 3 slices
