We finally wrapped things up and headed back to the hotel room to gear up for the evening. At this point in the Vegas trip things start to get a little fuzzy. At one point security showed up and told us to the keep the music down. To me, it can’t get loud enough but the surrounding rooms didn’t really agree. We eventually left the hotel and ended up at this place called Minus 5 in Mandalay Bay. We all had to wear these giant parkas with gloves to get in. Turns out it’s basically an igloo with a bar in it. Somehow I managed to take my coat off along with my shirt so some lady could take my picture. I am not sure where but if you dig hard enough I am sure you can find them.

After the ice bar we headed to New York New York. We posted up at this piano bar where I got the guy to play Bruce Springsteen after tipping him. We (I guess mainly I) danced for a while trying to get the soul train line going (which never works) and finally decided it was time to move on.

On our way out we noticed [a pizzeria](http://newyorknewyork.com/restaurants/ny-pizzeria.aspx) offering slices. Steve asked if I wanted a slice and it sounded like the perfect dinner. I ordered a slice of pepperoni and a water (like that would help me at this point) then headed over to grab and seat and dig in. Unfortunately I don’t’ remember much of the pizza. It was a larger square slice with a medium thickness. I also remember it being decent enough to eat very quickly. I managed to actually take a picture but it did not turn out at all so unfortunately have nothing to show. You just have to trust me on this one.

Dave and Jason opted for sushi and steak. Turns out something wasn’t cooked right and they both got a little food poisoning the next morning. Flying and basically traveling all day is never good when you are hungover and/or food poisoned. Just ask those two.

Final Rating: 3 slices
