Last weekend we decided to take our oldest to the movies. He saw the commercial for Rampage was pretty stoked about it so Ray brought up the idea of going to see being that we didn’t have plans that night. It was a bit of a quick decision and hadn’t eaten dinner yet so we decided to grab some food at the theater.

The Cinema Carousel has really classed it up in the last few years adding dinner options and alcohol. The name of the place inside that sells these thing is name [Oscar’s Bistro](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Oscars-Bistro/188748958167494). According to the internet most of the Celebration Cinema locations have these in them these days. They offer pizzas, salads, sliders, and a handful of appetizers. I ended up going with a pepperoni pizza and a Bell’s Two Hearted. The pizza only took a few minutes cook and a soon as it was up we headed into the theater.

The pizza was about 10 inches and in an oblong shape – the perfect for one person. The cheese was put on pretty heavy which made it very greasy. The curst was crisp enough to not fold on you even though they were pretty small pieces but still had a little chewiness to it. The sauce essentially got lost in the cheese but there were hints of the garliciness of it. The pepperonis were cooked pretty well giving a little bit of a crunch in contrast to the cheese.

All in all I thought [Oscar’s Bistro](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Oscars-Bistro/188748958167494) was pretty good. I don’t remember what I paid for the pizza and beer but it wasn’t cheap. Combine that with popcorn, candy, soda, and a slushie things start to add up. I suppose it is all part of the experience though. I wouldn’t seek out [Oscar’s](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Oscars-Bistro/188748958167494) for only dinner but if you want to combine dinner and a movie it is certainly a great choice.

Final Rating: 3 slices
