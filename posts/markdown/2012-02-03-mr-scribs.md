Once again I ended back Muskegon for the weekend. This should be a the last time for a while. I don’t have much of a reason to head back up there until like Mother’s Day. We can only hope. I was in town this time because Ray was buying a new car and the Swingin’ Steam Cells were playing. By the way if you get a chance to see those guys play a set give it a shot. I can’t guarentee you won’t be dissapointed but I can assure you it will be a good time.

Friday night I ended up at my Sister’s house to visit her and the neices and nephews. The talk of dinner came up then the talk of pizza soon followed. The little ones usually opt for Little Ceasar’s while my Sister order’s some better (and usually more expensive) for the adults. This time we decided on Mr. Scribs…one pepperoni and one deluxe. Let’s do it.

Unfortunately, the hard part was actually getting through to anyone there via the phone on a Friday night. You see, Mr. Scribs is, like some of the other pizza joints in Muskegon I’ve talked about, is some what of a staple. A very popular choice for pizza as far as I can remember back. I think if we didn’t live so much closer to Someplace Else growing up we probably would have ordered it a lot more (or at least my parents would have leaving me and my siblings still trying to avoid the noid down the street). There are still about five locatoins still around the area. For some reason, I thought there were more when I was growing up. My friend Justin used to work at the one Grand Haven and would talk about how people order pizzas to go (or have them shipped to them? I don’t remember) because they liked them so much. Perhaps the proof is in the pudding?

We picked up the pizzas, got back to my sister’s place and dug in. An interesting this about the presentation of the pizza is that they serve carry-out orders in paper bags as opposed to most places that use a box. So when you get home instead of opening a box you just tear the bag open. I have to figure that this is more popular of a thing than I am aware of. It’s jus the only place I know of that does it that I can think of.

On to the pizza. The goodness in this stuff lies in the sauce and the cheese. The combination of those two kind of seel the deal for most. The crust on the other hand doesn’t really do it for me. I would prefer a thicker, crispier curst with this style of pie. The overall thickness is kind of right in the middle somewhere like a typical pizza. I was pretty hungry by the time we ate and ended up taking down four slices of the peopperoni and one of the deluxe (along with a few of these deep-fried steak chuck things). So even though I didn’t prefer the crust it was still damn good.

Mr. Scribs has a proven track record. They first opened in 1961 and are still going strong. And if you ask anyone around town if they have a preferred pizza place I can guarantee it will be on the front of many people’s list. As for me, I don’t think I’m completely sold. That or I just don’t like to play favorites or maybe the place is just overhyped. Rumor is they were (or maybe still are) in the process of creating a deep dish option. If that’s the case this will be the first place I will be talking about it.
