This was an an interesting week. After getting back from Colorado, I was quickly back out of town again between playing rock shows and hanging with my Dad on Father’s day. After a fast weekend I didn’t do any grocery shopping and/or prepping for lunch during the week. So after eating out like every day I figure I’d pick a day for pizza. I have a list of pizza places to visit around my office for days like these. Especially joints that sell it by the slice. I recall one down Division a few miles so off I went….[Carlo’s Pizza Connection](http://www.carlospizzaconnection.com/) my destination.

Now here is where the fun part of this comes in. I really had no idea what I was getting myself into as far as this place was concerned. When I rolled up I saw a few construction workers taking down some slices so I was immediately excited. I had to passed through a beaded curtain and walked up to the counter. It was simple in there. A counter, drink cooler and a sign of what they had to offer. I opted for a slice of pepperoni and meat lovers Chicago Style.

Now this is where a little confusion sets in for me. I saw the guy reach in to the oven grab a couple of slices, box them up and send me on my way. In the back up my mind I keep thinking about this so-called Chicago Style. It certainly wasn’t the Chicago style I am accustom to.

Once I got back to my office I immediately did some research. It turns out (and I can’t believe I’ve never thought to look this up before) that all Chicago style really is is sauce and topping covered with cheese. That’s it in its simplest form. Now, there are variations but that’s it. I don’t know, I guess I was disappointed to find out that Chicago style can vary so much it’s basically may as we be eating New York. Oh well, I popped the box open and dug in. Man was I presently surprised.

I guess I wasn’t paying much attention when the guy at the counter was boxing up my food. The size of the slices seemed enormous. Cheesy…greasy…it was all there. With the crust buttered up the taste just exploded in my mouth. I seriously considered getting three slices because they were so cheap, there would be no way I could have driven all of it in.

Again, sometime you are pleasantly surprised at not only what is in your backyard but how far a few bucks can go these days. At $1.50 a slice I can guarantee this place is going to have a repeat customer. I ended walking out of the place with two slices and a can of pop for under $5. Sometimes nothing beats a good old-fashioned slice.

Final Rating: 4 slices
