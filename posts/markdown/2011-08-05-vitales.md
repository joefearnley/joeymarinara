This Saturday afternoon I happened to find myself out in what is called the Comstock Park area of Grand Rapids. I’ve never really been out in this area before. I think the only other time was on the way to a ski trip to Cannonsburg like 15 years ago. We were actually own our way to a White Caps game (which in the middle of summer on a particularly hot day felt like some sort of cesspool) and after a quick pizza search on my phone turned up a Fricano’s in the area. That sounded good until, well, we couldn’t find it. So as we ventured further into the Park we came across a couple of places in what seemed to be the downtown area. We settled on a place called [Vitale’s](http://www.theoriginalvitales.com/).

Apparently there are a few of these establishments throughout the area. The one we went to seemed very sports-barrish. I guess that the version in Comstock Park. The one cool thing about it was the back part of the place was basically outdoor seating covered at the top. It was a nice warm, sunny afternoon so we decided to sit out there. Getting to sit outside with my shades on and suck down dollar Stroh’s was exactly was the moment was calling for. Well that and pizza.

The choices for pizza were pretty typical. Different sizes, all the toppings you could want. Yet they also had a selection gourmet pies with one in particular, Spicy Lovers, that immediately caught my eye. The toppings included marinara sauce, spicy cappicola ham, jalapeno bacon and mozzarella cheese. I’d never heard of either meat topping but was immediately sold.

The pizza came out hot as could be served on a silver pedestal. It was almost dream like. The crust was right in the middle somewhere with the meat and cheese piled on high. So much that I had to eat it with silverware. But really there were no complaints at all. The bites melted in my mouth like tiny pieces of magic. The cheese and meat combo with slightly-fluffed crust made for a great taste and overall a great pie.

Again this was a great example of how the toppings can skew the results a bit. The further I move away from the standard cheese and pepperoni the harder it gets to form an opinion. But hey, it doesn’t hurt to step out of the norm sometimes and have a little fun with this. In this case it turned out to be a great idea.
