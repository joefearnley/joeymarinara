Last Friday was an interesting one. I had the afternoon off of work and had to head to Grand Rapids for some business. I figured I would grab some lunch either on the way or when arrived in the city. I did a quick search of pizza places on the way and stumbled across a couple located in Hudsonville. One (which I don’t recall the name of) did not have much of a web presence so it was pretty much out. The other had a website that mentioned it served pizza by the slice. The search was done and I was off to [DJ’s Pizza Pub](https://www.djspizzapub.com/).

[DJ’s](https://www.djspizzapub.com/) is located in Hudsonville in a strip mall surrounded but a bunch of other retail business. It sits at the end of the mall with outdoor seating extending into the parking lot. They offer pizza, wings, subs, salads, and more. When you enter the main entrance, straight ahead in the counter where you can order food including slice of pizza during lunch time. They had a few specials running that day that consisted of a bunch of different pies including a Chicago style and Taco.

My options were limited at the moment so I ended up buying a couple of slices of the meat lovers because they were available. After paying the woman at the counter I headed to the bar area that was adjacent to the counter area. I ordered a beer at the bar and grabbed a table to eat.

The meat lover’s was a combination of ham, pepperoni, sausage, and bacon. The crust had a little thickness to it and was nice and chewy. The topping were plentiful and created the classic meat lover’s burst of flavors. Between the amount of meat and cheese on the slices, the sauce got a little lost but was still tasty. After two slices of this stuff I was done.

According to the website, [DJ’s Pizza Pub](https://www.djspizzapub.com/) has been around since 1982. Based on how busy lunch time was it seemed like it is a staple in Hudsonville Overall the pizza was great. I probably could have only ordered one slice with a beer and have been fine. Also, the guy across from me was eating a sub and it looked very tasty. I can bet this won’t be my last visit to [DJ’s](https://www.djspizzapub.com/) as the other pizza offering were enticing. If you are ever in Hudsonville looking for a bite, especially during lunch time, be sure to check out [DJ’s Pizza Pub](https://www.djspizzapub.com/).
