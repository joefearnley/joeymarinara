Well the holiday season has officially started. I suppose it started about a month ago depending on who you ask, but this is Christmas, a time to spend with family and friends. This particular Friday night I was planning on meeting up with some friends at a local establishment in Muskegon. Minutes after arriving Shann came through the door with a few pies from [Glenside Pub](http://www.glensidepub.net/) and offered some up. I thanked her and grabbed a plate.

The house I grew up in was only a few minutes from Glenside Pub. Although back then it was named Some Place Else but the pizza was the same. We ordered from here on a regular basis. It was either that or Dominoes that was a few blocks down the street. I used to go up there with my dad. He’d order a beer and a pizza and I would order a Coke. Ah memories.

The only option on this night was some sort of deluxe version with multiple meats. I usually don’t opt for deluxe but I was pretty hungry and it smelled damn good. Glenside Pub’s pizza reminds me a lot of Martini’s in that the sauce is exceptional. It’s really what makes the pizza. Combine the sweet sauce with more than enough cheese and you got yourself a great pie. And of course, party cut.

The weird part about this was I actually ate Glenside Pub pizza a week before while at my parents but never got a picture of it. I haven’t had the stuff in years and now had it two weeks in a row. If you ever find yourself in Muskegon with a hunkering for pizza I’d suggest checking out Glenside Pub.
