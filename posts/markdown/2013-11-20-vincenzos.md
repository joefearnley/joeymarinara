My original plan was to hit up this place in Grandville. I mean, I had time, but I didn’t feel likedriving across town to grab pizza. I suppose it’s part of the thrill though. While heading over there I passed a place called Vincenzo’s. I had seen the place before but I had no idea if the place offered any slices for lunch but I figured I would pop in and find out. Sure enough, they had a couple pies under the heat lamp and ready to go.

There was half a pepperoni and a cheese at the time. They looked to be about 12” and the slices were ¼ of the pie. It was before noon so I am guessing they weren’t out very long. They were only $1.50 a slice so I got two pepperoni and one cheese. The woman behind the counter asked if I wanted parmesan on them and I said yes. She took them back in the kitchen area and covered them in cheese. I paid her and took off back to my office.

I have to be honest, after checking them out behind the glass they did not look appealing. Before I paid for them I thought I would just say screw it and head to the place in Grandville but I was already there and I could always head to Grandville another day.

All I can say was my initial thought was wrong. I dug into the cheese slice first. And cheesy it was. The initial layer of it was thick causing the grease to flow down the palm of my hand. The parmesan on top just added to it. The crust wasn’t very thick, but soft and chewy. After the first slice I knew immediately I was going to regret getting three. The pepperoni was no different. The cheese was piled on thick but the curst seemed a little crispier on these ones. The sauce wasn’t very apparent but that didn’t matter. The pepperoni’s added that little spicy kick that picked up where the sauced. Finally, after three of these bad boys I was ready for a nap.

Vincenzo’s is great little place and somewhat hidden in the bowels of Wyoming. Checking out their menu after the fact showed they also offered plenty of other food besides pizza. Subs, spaghetti, wraps and even some Mexican dishes thrown in for fun. If you are ever around 44th St in Wyoming and looking to grab a quick, cheap bite I would strongly suggest this place. You will be pleasently surprised.

Final Rating: 4 slices
