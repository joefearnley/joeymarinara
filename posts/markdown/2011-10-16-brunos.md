I’ve been wanting to check out Bruno’s for a long time. Even when I spent every day on Western’s campus I never made it into the place. This particular Wednesday we needed something for dinner, decided on pizza and went with Bruno’s. I called up and ordered a large pepperoni and cheese, ready in twenty minutes.

For those of you who don’t know it’s located a few block from WMU’s campus right across the street from the track. If you drive anywhere near the area, it is really had to miss the sign outside. I’m not sure when the place originally opened but something tells me not a whole lot has changed with the place since then. It has a lot of character, especially inside. It reminds me of an old diner with a counter up front and a video game machine ready to be played. As I was walking in the pick up the pizza I saw that had a guy in the window (in the kitchen really) spinning some dough in the air building a hand-crafted pie. This is my kind of place. If you do plan to eat here, I’d suggest dining in. I have yet to do it and still plan to.

I got the pizza home and cracked the box. Of course it was party cut (I’m not completely sure how to say correctly, still figuring it out) so that was cool. Except as far as the grid is concerned I think they missed a side because it had some really elongated slices mixed in there. The taste overall was great. I mean, I don’t really know what else to say. I suppose they could have put more toppings as I felt like I was doing a lot of hunting and pecking for the pepperoni. I don’t like a ton of peps on my shit but I think they slacked a little in that department. In the immortal words of Joe Clark….“Defeat is not bitter unless you swallow it.” Words to live by kids.

One thing to note is that I don’t have any pictures of the actual pizza. I took some but lost them while upgrading my phones operating system and I’m still trying to figure out how to get them back. So I resorted to taking a picture of the building to add something visual to this entry. I'l update this post with more pictures the next time I go. Hopefully with some of the inside as well.
