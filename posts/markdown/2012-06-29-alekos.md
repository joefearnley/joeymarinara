Anyone who has been on a business trip knows the pitfalls of trying to eat healthy. It can be very difficult. This is especially true working for a food service company. I managed to lose 10 lbs. this past spring but whatever I managed to already gain back by going off the diet I was on I certainly gained back this past week. I don’t think I have ever eaten as much in my life. Not on a vacation, not a holiday, never.

One of the nights over the weekend they brought in some pizza for dinner. It was ordered from a place called [Aleko’s](http://alekoscarryout.com/) from a neighboring town. To be honest, I was still pretty full from the soul food meal served to us at lunch consisting of ribs, corn bread, red beans & rice, fried chicken and gumbo but when someone mentioned they ordered pizza and I got a couple of whiffs of it I went to see what the options were. They ordered about five different kinds of pies. The chicken barbecue was looking really good but in my attempt to keep the playing field level, I grabbed a slice of pepperoni and another of meat lovers (pepperoni, ham, sausage and bacon) and headed back to the conference room.

I wouldn’t say the pizza was anything beyond average. By no means was this a bad thing it was just that nothing really stuck out to me. It had all the things to make it great but was just a little lacking. It certainly didn’t help that I wasn’t really even that hungry to begin with but hey man, pizza is pizza and when offered up I’m always going accept. I supposed some times are better than others.

If you ever find yourself in southeastern Michigan and are looking for pizza, Aleko’s is a great option and seems to be all over the area. You won’t be disappointed by any means just don’t expect great things. And if what their website says about them is true they are family owned and pride on quality and customers service. You can never go wrong with that.
