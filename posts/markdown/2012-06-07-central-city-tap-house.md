After realizing a couple of friends actually ended up staying in town last weekend we decided to hit the town Friday night and grab something to eat. Then if weather permitted, [greek fest](http://www.kalamazoogreekfest.com/) was going on down the road so we could catch some of the Night Ranger show if it was going on late enough. I saw a tweet earlier in the day from [Central City Tap House](http://www.millenniumrestaurants.com/central-city-tap-house/) mentioning they have new pizzas on the menu. Since I’ve been trying to get back on this pizza train I suggested we check it out.

Now for those of you unfamiliar with the establishment, Central City Tap House is downtown and connected to the Epic Bistro. It’s a neat little bar with a bunch of delicious beers on tap as well as good food. Unfortunately for us, we got there at prime dinner time on a Friday so it was full. The consensus was we had walked far enough and there was seating available in the bistro wo we decided to dine there. So technically, yes, this pizza was served from Epic Bistro but I am crediting the Taphouse with baiting the suggestion and the food would have been the same if I’d eaten it there or the next room over.

We sat down and ordred some drinks. This gave me some time to looks at the new pizza options they had to offer. They had a couple ones [I’d seen before](http://joeymarinara.com/post/6524233118/epic-bistro) and four or so new options. The one that caught my eye was called the Diavola. Mozzarella, capicola, tomato sauce and topped with pepperoncini. It sounded fantastic and ordered on up.

The pie came out hot. Fresh from the wood-fired oven and ready to eat. I don’t remember looking at the size on the menu but it was big enough and not too overwhelming. The crust was quite thin and the toppings sprinkled on accordingly. One of the first things I remember after getting a pepper on my tongue was the heat. The spicy meat along with pepperoncini and (from what I could tell) red pepper under the cheese created a little hotness I was not expecting. Chasing it with beer didn’t help either as my brow began to sweat and at one point the waiter asked me if I couldn’t handle the Diavola. Oh trust me, I can handle it. [I’m on the Wall of Flame](http://blog.joefearnley.com/post/1039788320/sunday-social-46-wing-challange) for christ’s sake. It just caught me a little off guard and overall the combination of the toppings created a great flavor for the pizza.

Dave ended up also ordering a pie. He opted for the spinach and steak combination. We both agreed it left a lot to be desired especially after comparing it to the Diavola. It looked really good when it came out but the taste was very bland. The steak seemed to be done right but no sign of juices or seasoning. It was pretty disappointing.

Unfortunately we did not make it out to see Night Ranger. It would have been great to see Brad Gillis shred one more time but oh well. It’s possible the band will be back in town some day and I ended up with a stomach full of great pizza. If you get the chance, I would certainly check it out.

Final Rating: 4 slices
