Wow, what a weekend. I can’t get into too many details of the what or the how but let me just say there will not be one like it for a while. Maybe ever. I had a couple friends come in from out of town (and one stay in town) and before they made their trek back to the windy city we had to meet a carpooler at [Gallagher’s](http://www.gallagherseatery.com/). So we headed up to meet Bob and I was in the mood for pizza.

Well not exactly…it was the only fitting thing on the menu at the time. You see, we used to go to Gallagher’s every Monday night for the half-off bottles about 4-5 years ago in hopes to drink all the beers around the world and get a name on a mug. It was a great time, back when several of my friends still lived here. Some of those times Rachel and I would head up there early for dinner and nothing on the menu ever looked or tasted good. I understand it’s the pub section (I guess there is an “eatery” section in the front but I have never been) but nothing I have every ordered for dinner there ever hooked my buds. Yes there is dark wood and Irish stew (and a crummy jukebox) but unless it’s St. Patty’s Day who’s going to be into that shit?

So this particular Sunday was a rainy one in May and it’s pretty much dead as a doornail inside Gallagher’s . The best looking thing on the menu is the pizza. I went with the three cheese with choice of topping option (pepperoni of course). I wouldn’t say that I was completely disappointed by the taste, size and everything about it, I’d say it was I was hopeful….for something better. They tried, I’ll give them that but looking over at Steve and Dave’s breakfast burgers my regrets began to beckin. I asked Jack what he thought but don’t remember what he said. We’ll have to agree to disagree. Next time I’ll opt for the BBQ.
