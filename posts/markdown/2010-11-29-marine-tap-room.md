I was in Muskegon for Thanksgiving and having a four day weekend and seeing your family in the first one, things get a little boring. Indeed that Friday eventually turned into what some would call quite the shit show (including a house part with break dancing) and it all started around lunch time at Marine Tap Room.

I wasn’t particularly hungry at the time but some one ordered up a few pizzas which I think were on special for $5 for lunch. I was offered a couple slices and rolled with it. Even though I was a few beers deep I can’t say that the taste was bad. I think that sold it for me was the cheese. I’ve had better but I’ve had a lot worse.

Even though hunger pains were not trolling through my body I could have probably taken down an entire pie that day. The weather was cold but the combination of cheap beer and cheap pizza did it for me. I’ll probably never go to the tap room looking for pizza again but it’s nice to say that I experienced it once.
