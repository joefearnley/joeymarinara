The other night one of the bands I play in, [Protected Left](http://protectedleft.org/), played in Kalamazoo at [The Strutt](http://thestrutt.com/). The place has only been around a couple of years. I think before it was The Strutt it was a coffee house with a different name and according to some fellows at work was a record shop back in the nineties. Over the last year I’ve been to this place quite a few times mainly to see bands play, never really to just hang out. So of course, I’ve never tried their food.

If you can handle the hipsters it’s not a bad place to hang. Since we were playing last I was kind of forced to hang out there for a few hours. I hadn’t eaten dinner yet so I asked for a menu. Overall everything looked pretty tasty. I was expecting food snob’s paradise with vegan versions of everything. But they kept it real. And of course, they had pizza.

Basically they offer one size: the 14 inche (I think). There were a bunch of different options combinations you could order (see the selection on [the menu](http://thestrutt.com/Pizzas.php)) or you could roll your own. Mario soon got wind of me wanted to order pizza and offered to split one with me. The problem was though, Mario is a vegetarian and to keep things consistent for Joey Marinara I always order pepperoni sometimes with an additional meat variant. I waiter offered to split the topping but I decided to take the high road and let Mario decide the toppings.

We ended up with mozzarella and feta cheeses along with spinach and roasted red peppers. I don’t mind the cheese or even the spinach (thanks to one time in Chicago) but I’ve never been a fan of peppers on the pie. I figured hey, let’s mix it up a bit and rolled with it.

The pizza came out super warm and we decided to head outside to eat (apparently they don’t turn the air on in The Strutt if only ten people show up to your show). Even after getting a couple smells off the pizza I was still a little weary about the toppings but after the first bite all was clear. For me it was all about the cheese. The mozzarella and feta combo was a match made in heaven. There could have been green beans stuff in the inside of that thing and it wouldn’t have mattered, I would have taken it in.

Once all was said and done I probably ate too much. We didn’t start playing until after midnight so I had plenty of time to digest everything. I’d like to give this place this pizza another shot to try out some meatier toppings. I’m beginning to learn that what goes on top can drastically make a difference in taste.

Final Rating: 4 slices
