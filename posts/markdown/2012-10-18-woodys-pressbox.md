Recently there have been a couple recent changes in my work life. My company built a brand new office that we moved in to. Previous to this, most of the employees in the area worked out of a bunch of different offices. Pretty much all of them moved into what has been dubbed _The Home Office_. My team also hired two new members and one thing we usually do is take them out to lunch their first day. We rounded up some people and head to [Woody’s Pressbox](http://www.spectrumlanes.com/) which is down the street.

I’ve only been to Woody’s one other time and that was for after works beers with a couple of teammates. So this was officially my first time eating here. The place is interesting. There is a big bar in the middle that is the first thing you see when you walk in. There is a decently-sized dining area and a bowling alley in the back. They offer a buffet with assorted foods including, salads, tacos, roasted chicken and pizza. Of course as soon as I heard pizza I opted for the buffet.

Once I got my first slice of pie I began to second guess myself. I probably should have done a once over to see what it looked like but I have a blog to write with possible loyal readers. That and I could also opt for a taco if it wasn’t very good.

The first round included a slice of the pepperoni and a breadstick. The flavor was pretty sub par. I’d equate it to that of a frozen pizza. Not that there is anything wrong with frozen pizza as I eat them all the time it’s just that I expect a little more from a restaurant. I went up for more at one point but they were out. I waited a bit and went up to the buffet to find a ham and what appeared to be ground beef pie fresh out of the oven. I’d say this version of the pizza might have won me over except for the ground beef. I think it’s just one ingredient that should stay off of pizza.

Given a choice, I probably wouldn’t go to Woody’s again for lunch. At least wouldn’t go with the lunch buffet. I did end up having a taco and that wasn’t very good. I didn’t really look at the other options on the menu to see if there was anything appealing. I’ll certainly give it a scan next time.

Final Rating: 2 slices
