It’s a warm Tuesday night what better way to spend it than getting some cold beer and wood-fired pizza. Rachel and I decided to hit up The Hangar: our local, airplane-hangar-themed restaurant. We kind of wore this place out after moving to where we live now, but it made sense on this particular evening.

The place is actually a pretty descent sports bar. There are TV’s everywhere that always has something on special (be sure to check out what they have cooking on Friday nights). It makes a great place to watch the wings play. And of course they have pizza. Wood-fired to be exact with a bunch of different options ranging from BBQ chicken to margarita. I chose the flight plan where you basically build your own keeping it simple with pepperoni and black olives. 

In all honesty, the pizza wasn’t anything special. It’s wood-fired so if you’re into that sort of thing it’s probably right up your alley. They are served in a 9" option as sort of a personal size (there may be other options for bigger ones, something I have never tried to order). I took most of it down and saved the rest for lunch the next day. This combined with a cold blue moon it really hit the spot.

This wasn’t the first time I’ve had the pizza at The Hangar and certainly won’t be the last. I’ve tried a few other things on the menu and it seems to be the only I keep coming back too. Next time I will have to change the flight plan up, maybe add a little flair.

Final Rating: 3 slices
