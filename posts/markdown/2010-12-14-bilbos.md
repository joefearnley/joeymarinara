The holiday season is approaching, it’s getting damn cold here in Michigan and Rachel and I are hungry. To continue on our quest to find the ultimate pizza we decided to hit up another Kalamazoo Staple: [Bilbo’s Pizza](http://www.bilbospizza.com/). It was a slow Wednesday night and the restaruant had a weird vibe going on that night that I can’t really explain.

The location on Stadium Drive is closer to our house so that’s the one we chose. The restaurant apparently brews its own beer and had a pretty good selection. It also has a Lord of the Rings vibe where everything on the menu is named after something relating to the story. I remember several years back they used to boast about winning some award regarding best pizza in town or something. I don’t know if I’d totally agree.

We ended up ordering a small Chicago-style (or was it the stuffed? not sure) with an order of “stix” and dill dip. Apparently the dill dip is some sort of hot seller that but I really wasn’t a fan. The pizza on the other hand was pretty good. Again, it was some sort of this styled with a parmesan crust, thick even more parmesaned sauce, and some mozzarella. We cut the pie into some cute little slices and ate away. Good, not great and I will certainly eat there again.

One thing Rachel would let go was the fact that the staff seemed to all be flirting with each other. I guess you are all college students and it’s a slow night but jesus people, this is a place of business. Frankly I don’t care what you do at work just always make sure my beer is full. I was able to let it go but Rachel could not and it kind of waned on our dining experience. I think I’ve going to have a hard time talking her into going back.

Final Rating: 4 slices
