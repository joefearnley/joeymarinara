This past Sunday I left for Canada for a week for a work-related trip so this past weekend was spent at home tying up a few loose ends. After a long week at work we were sitting at home Friday night contemplating dinner and didn’t feel like cooking or going anywhere. We eventually decided on pizza and after even more contemplating on where to get it from we ended up going with [Happy’s](http://www.happyspizza.com/).

I’ve only been to Happy’s one other time. It was a few years ago shortly after they opened their first location in Kalamazoo. That time we opted for chicken and ribs. We thought it was pretty rad that they sold beer out of coolers inside the restaurant. We ended up buying tall boys and drinking them while eating our dinner only to look over see a sign that read something along the lines of “Please do not drink alcohol in the dining area”. I a made note to not do that again.

One cool things about Happy’s is that they always some sort of special going on. Whether it is on their website, coupons that come with the paper or the monthly student saver magazine, you’re sure find some sort of deal Happy’s is offering. I have to be honest, when looking at their normal pizza, I didn’t get very excited. The deep dish on the other had was a different story. They had a special on their website offering an extra large deep dish and bread sticks for $15. I was sold and ordered up a pepperoni for pick up.

About 30 minutes later I picked up the pizza and brought it home. One of the first things I noticed was that it didn’t look that fresh. They said it would be ready in 15 minutes and I must have picked it up within 20 so it shouldn’t have been sitting around that long. After taking the first bite it definitely wasn’t that fresh. The cheese was a bit congealed. The crust tasted like it was cooked, killed and brought back to life. The pepperoni was, well, just kind of there. I think in the ended I ate two pieces, which with the think crust and a breadstick or two, was plenty to fill me up and frankly, all I wanted.

I had high hopes for Happy’s but in the end it left me disappointed. I forgot to mention that we also ordered some ribs tips that were pretty good but it was hard to get past how bad the pizza was. I was talking to someone about my experience and they mentioned to be suspicious when a place has a menu with such variety. That places should just stick two a smaller amount and make them really good. I think that can be applied in all aspects of life. It certainly did in this case. If you end up giving Happy’s a go, I’d stick with the barbecue, you’ll be safe there.
