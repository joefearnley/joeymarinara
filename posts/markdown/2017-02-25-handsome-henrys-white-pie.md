This past Sunday Ray and I found ourselves with one less child and not much to do so we decided to go out to eat. With the options for dinner a little limited because of Sunday so we decided to go to Handsome Henry’s. We packed up the little one and headed out.

[I’ve written about Handsome Henry’s](#%E2%80%9Dhttp://joeymarinara.com/post/774577279/handsome-henrys%E2%80%9D) [a couple of times](#%E2%80%9Dhttp://joeymarinara.com/post/16193571936/handsome-henrys-deep-dish%E2%80%9D) but this time the pizza was a little unique. This time around I ordered the White Pizza which consists of Alfredo sauce, chicken, bacon, mushrooms, and Gouda cheese. I opted for no mushrooms and called it good.

The pizza was cooked perfectly. The crust was thin and crispy. I’ve never had Alfredo sauce on my pizza but the combination with that and the Gouda was awesome. The chicken was cook just right and adding bacon to anything makes it better. I ended up eating the whole thing along with a couple of Perrin blacks. It was great.

At this point I have had four different pizzas from [Handsome Henry’s](#%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.handsomehenrys.com%E2%80%9D) and all were very good. My favorite was probably the deep dish but the Crab Rangoon was not bad either. If you ever find yourself at [Handsome Henry’s](#%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.handsomehenrys.com%E2%80%9D) and you can’t decide on a dish, pick the White Pizza. You can’t lose.

Final Rating: 4 slices
