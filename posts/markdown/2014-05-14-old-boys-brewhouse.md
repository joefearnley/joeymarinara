Earlier this week, Ray and I found ourselves with a babysitter and the opportunity for just us to go out to eat. I pitched the idea of pizza. After attending [the Grand Pizza & Beer Fest](http://joeymarinara.com/post/156382862709/grand-pizza-beer-fest) a while back I brought up the idea of [Old Boy’s Brewhouse](http://www.oldboysbrewhouse.com/) after trying it for the first time. She agreed and we went on our way.

[Old Boy’s](http://www.oldboysbrewhouse.com/) is located in Spring Lake, MI, just as you get into town coming from Grand Haven. It’s been around since the late 90’s and I’ve driven by it a ton of times but I’ve never been. When we arrived there, it was pretty slow so we got seated right away.

The inside was surprisingly spacious. One of the first things I realized was there was some sort of dog theme going with the place. There were lots of pictures of dogs on the walls and the menu had bones and paw prints throughout it. I guess I never noticed it but even the sign had a bone on it. The menu was even shaped like a fire hydrant.

The menu offers way more than pizza. They also have sandwiches, Mexican dishes, steak, and even fish if you are feeling up to it. I really wanted more of what we sampled a couple of weeks before so we decided on a modified version of their specialty pizza the True Italian which consisted of pepperoni, capicola, and Italian sausage (and of course, a pint of the Dogtail IPA to go with it).

About 10 to 15 minutes later the pizza came out. I didn’t ask about the size of the pizzas but if I had to guess I would say they were 12 inches. Technically these pizzas are thin crust, but with the amount of cheese and toppings piled on (along with a little giardiniera for some hot goodness) it seemed kind of thick. I love the combination of capicola and pepperoni. That along with the typical melted mozzarella and asiago adding a punch, this pie was everything I hoped for and more.

[Old Boy’s](http://www.oldboysbrewhouse.com/) ended up being a good choice for dinner. The theme of the place certainly threw me off a little but the pizza and beer made up for it. With the explosion of craft beer over the last several years, it seems like Old Boy’s could have been at the forefront of it. This place should be huge. Someone should tell the marketing people over there to step on it because the clock is ticking.

Final Rating: 4 slices
