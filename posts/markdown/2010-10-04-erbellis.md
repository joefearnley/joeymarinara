Alright, now we get to the good parts. When I mentioned that some things are almost mythical the other side of that is how known something is. Known in a good way. This past weekend we choose to eat at [Erbelli’s Gourmet Pizzeria, Italian Bistro & Pub](http://www.erbellis.com/). I know it’s a mouthful but so is the pizza and want to keep stuffing more in.

This wasn’t my first time here. I’d been to the one out in Portage several years ago and the newer one off of Stadium Drive. I’ve only been there on the weekend and it’s always packed at dinner time. One of the first things you notice about Erbelli’s menu is how many different choices you have for pizza. It’s a little over whelming actually. I was in the mood for some Chicago style so the waitress said the closest thing at the time would be the stuffed pizza.

This style is basically two crusts stuff with cheese and covered with signature sauce. It was so thick I had to use a fork to eat it. The sauce was on the sweet side and the mozzarella from the inside was oozing all over my plate. Two slices in I certainly wanted more but my stomach was saying no. I had to fold but it wasn’t because of the taste.

I would really like to try some of the other pizza options on Erbelli’s menu. These things take time. One day I am going to be able to hit up the lunch buffet to be able to try multiple selections at once. As for now I can only hope they will be as good as what I’ve had so far.

Final Rating: 5 slices
